B00002262M,"Has anyone ever tried to drill into this base to secure a machine to it better? (Grizzly 17"" bandsaw)",I paid $42 for these (each) and bought 4 sets.  They are OK for the money.  Decent quality but the plastic lifting handle will probably break off some time soon.,Y,N,,,
B00002262M,"Has anyone ever tried to drill into this base to secure a machine to it better? (Grizzly 17"" bandsaw)",Deliver fast. Strong as heck and been holding a very heavy shaper for long time now wheels still holding up and been rolled across the shop countless times.,Y,N,,,
B00002262M,"Has anyone ever tried to drill into this base to secure a machine to it better? (Grizzly 17"" bandsaw)",Assembly is straight forward and simple.

B00002262M,"Has anyone ever tried to drill into this base to secure a machine to it better? (Grizzly 17"" bandsaw)",Well-constructed easy to tailor size to the machine looks like it will last... used it to make my bandsaw mobile.,Y,N,,,
B00002262M,"Has anyone ever tried to drill into this base to secure a machine to it better? (Grizzly 17"" bandsaw)","This is my second mobile base of this model; after the first one there was no question I'd buy HTC again.  This one is for a Grizzly Hybrid saw while the other is holding my router table/stand.It looks like some of the other mobile bases do not have the easy kick stands which would be a huge detriment especially since I'll sometimes move my machines around more than once in a day.  The back wheels are fixed so turning to get into a tight space might take a couple of tries but no big deal.  If your floor is very imperfect or it slopes because of a drain you might find it annoying to have to change the leveling feet every time you try out a new space.  However if you have one place where you work and one place where you store the machine this won't be an issue.For my router stand I made a rectangle that was larger in one dimension than the product description said would work for the ""max rectangle"" but it was close enough to a square that it still worked just fine - it's just that if you are too large in one direction you use up the extra supports so that they are not available in the other direction.  After not needing some extra brackets for the table saw rig I could probably put them toward a larger rectangle on the next machine although I would not want to go all the way up to the max weight rating in that case.Oh the holes lined up correctly with the two factory holes in my Grizzly 715P.",Y,N,,,
B00002262M,"Has anyone ever tried to drill into this base to secure a machine to it better? (Grizzly 17"" bandsaw)",I purchased this base for a Grizzly bandsaw.  I thought the ease of installation was OK.  Make sure to measure you machine before assembly.  It is too much of a pain to take apart again.  Did have one problem with plastic foot lever cracking after a few weeks of use.  HTC customer service was great and immediately sent another one.  Apparently this is a common issue.  Otherwise the base works expected.,Y,N,,,
B00002262M,"Has anyone ever tried to drill into this base to secure a machine to it better? (Grizzly 17"" bandsaw)",I have used these before and they work well. I have my Grizzlt G0555 band saw on one and now I have my medal lathe and stand mounted on one. They are made that you can make them fit just about any large shop tool that you may want to make easy to move. The lathe is a 10x20 lathe and base. It has to be close to the load limit. I use it to move it all the time with no problem. I just ordered another one for my old 17 inch Rockwell drill press and stand.,Y,N,,,
B00002262M,"Has anyone ever tried to drill into this base to secure a machine to it better? (Grizzly 17"" bandsaw)","I purchased two of these mobile bases based on the reviews. All of my major tools are on wheels due to my workshop being in my garage.I have tried several different bases ranging from the bases that are designed for a specific tool to those by Delta that required wood runners for the sizing.After reading the reviews I gave this base a try. I am very glad that I did. These items arrived in great condition and all of the parts included. The final product when assembled is very sturdy and moves smoothly over my uneven floor. For space saving and toe stubbing I chose to must the riser handles to the inside of the bases and it works just fine. The size adjustment makes it user friendly to numerous tool footprints.The tools I have used them for include an 8"" jointer and a 17"" band saw. The weight has not been an issue with either tool. Even though the band saw is 6' tall it is still very stable.The price on this base is very competitive and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a mobile base.",Y,N,,,
B00002262M,"Has anyone ever tried to drill into this base to secure a machine to it better? (Grizzly 17"" bandsaw)",I used this for my new Grizzly bandsaw and it really is great.

Note my drill press base did not align with the holes. You may need a piece of plywood or something to create our own base if you need to secure it.,Y,N,,,
B000RKQ1NI,Would these goggles be fit for a Chemistry Lab?,it does fog,Y,N,,,
B000RKQ1NI,Would these goggles be fit for a Chemistry Lab?,I've only used them briefly but they are certainly comfortable. They didn't fog in my basement workshop which is at 76 degrees 55% humidity. They are a little hard to put on over my small prescription glasses but grabbing the sides and pulling out while putting them on usually works and my glasses just ride a little high on my nose.Recommended but gave them 4 stars because they're made by our frenemy China.,Y,N,,,
B000RKQ1NI,Would these goggles be fit for a Chemistry Lab?,I love the google I bought them when I work with plaster and sheetrock since I have alergy on it. My eyes burned when I worked in dust but not anymore.,Y,N,,,

B000RKQ1NI,Would these goggles be fit for a Chemistry Lab?,"I am writing to say that I appreciate these goggles but would suggest that you consider other options as well.I have some experience to support my thoughts.  As a lab rat of several years (decades?) standing with fairly high-level medical training I have personally tried a number of eye protection schemes.  Many but not all of them have been involved in low level radiation and biohazard protection which is most often less serious than metal or woodworking hazards.The possible solutions fall into three major categories:  1)  plastic ""glasses"" for people who wear no eye correction or who wear contacts 2)  goggles (like the DeWalt model here) and 3)  full face shields.The primary consideration is whether the protection is something you will actually wear.  You simply do not know until you try good examples of all three classes what actually works for you.  So if you are serious about preserving your vision just suck it up and be willing (if you're unhappy with  the first option you pick) to try more than one.The options for people without optically correcting glasses of their own include all three schemes.  While polycarbonate ""glasses"" with side protectors are good for major chips or particles they allow a fair amount of dust to pass near your eyes.  That will be mostly irritating but not hugely dangerous for exposures of minutes to hours.  Goggles like the DeWalt's are better as long as you wear them and they don't fog.  I find this set to be a pretty good (comfortable and dust-reducing) solution.  Full face masks are better protection against large chips but still allow a fair amount of dust by your eyes.If you wear full-frame glasses my experience suggests that full face mask solutions are often the most workable.  Most polycarbonate  ""glasses-like"" solutions that fit over your real glasses tend to knock your real ones out of place easily:  that pretty much ends the experiment.  Goggles with a fair amount of room under them like these DeWalt's can be good but are still a bit troublesome.  This set tends to fog fairly little compared to others I've tried and only knocks your real glasses out of place a bit when you take them on and off.  I would rate them as very good compared to most of the competition.  However that's still enough to make me wear them less than I should.  As I write this I'm waiting for a goofy looking full-face shield that I know from work experience is best for me.YMMV but please spend the time now to fix the problem for the next few years...you'll really like being able to see your friends and family not just your work.",Y,N,,,
B000RKQ1NI,Would these goggles be fit for a Chemistry Lab?,Fit well over my prescription glasses and feel comfortable.Great protection for the price.I would recommend for any home workshop.,Y,N,,,
B000RKQ1NI,Would these goggles be fit for a Chemistry Lab?,I had to use this for my scenic construction class really good material have dropped multiple times getting just small scratches. The expandable band is comfortable and easily adjustable. I would not suggest these if you have a wide big head like me. Plus if you do need to where glasses like me you would really only be able to use these goggles if you have thin reading glasses not the big thick framed DG glasses. I had to use my old thin framed glasses which also doesn't help to the already big head thing because if you have a wide face then you would have to pull the headband reeeeaaaallly tight! Tight because if you're working around a wood shop you obviously don't want dust flying into your eyes(happened twice) and then taking off both glasses & goggles just to get that darn chip out of your eye. I admit I never really wore them tight and after just an hour I would have deep red lines on the side of my eyes. I really still like them would use again especially after having a Medium Crown staple shot at me @ 100psi by accident thankfully hitting my leg not face. Protection ladies and gentlemen.,Y,N,,,
B000RKQ1NI,Would these goggles be fit for a Chemistry Lab?,They fit nicely.  They fit well over prescription glasses.  Now if they wouldn't fog up I could see with them.  The day was much less than 80 degrees and they fogged a lot but they might work well on cool days.If I had known they would fog I would have tried a different product so I'm adding this comment for others.,Y,N,,,
B000RKQ1NI,Would these goggles be fit for a Chemistry Lab?,It it hard to believe Dewalt would market these goggle as anti-fog. They actually seem worse than cheaper alternatives. Other than a terrible fogging tendancy the only other chacteristic that stands out is they are quite comfortable. Probable the most comfortable i have ever tried -- including ski swimming motorcycle lab etc.In my experience the only goggles that are truly anti-fog are double layer ski goggles. You can find these in clear at various sporting goods outlets.,Y,N,,,
B000RKQ1NI,Would these goggles be fit for a Chemistry Lab?,Much better than plain old lab goggles. I've never had these fog up on me and they fit nice and snug and are comfortable to wear.,Y,Y,,,
B003QKS4Z4,Does this gizmo work with LED lamps? Phillips LED lightbuld in particular.,works great once adjusted.  Required some adjusting of &#34;on&#34; beam on install but after that worked perfectly and avoids the hard to reach switch now.  Wish they were cheaper I'd buy several more!,Y,N,,,
B003QKS4Z4,Does this gizmo work with LED lamps? Phillips LED lightbuld in particular.,I have four of these.  They have been running flawlessly for about 4 months.  I don't have to worry about anyone leaving the lights on -- very handy devices.  Sensitivity works fine.  Nice product.,Y,N,,,

B003QKS4Z4,Does this gizmo work with LED lamps? Phillips LED lightbuld in particular.,This works great.  I just wish it was Made in USA that is why it did not receive a full five stars from me.  I have used mine with both the CFL and LED type lightbulbs.  It works every time I open my closet doors!,Y,Y,,,
B003QKS4Z4,Does this gizmo work with LED lamps? Phillips LED lightbuld in particular.,This is literally a piece of junk.It's not sensitive at all it might flicker even with LED bulbs.it doesn't last long.I gave up after buying 3 of these and replaced with in-wall Lutron.,Y,Y,,,
B003QKS4Z4,Does this gizmo work with LED lamps? Phillips LED lightbuld in particular.,This product made me tossed out all the battery operated LED motion sensing lights.  I hate changing those batteries every couple of days and the LED light source is weak.  This First Alert product eliminated all of that.  You can use as bright a bulb as you'd like.  The motion sensor zone can be a bit tricky to set up.  But other reviewers have gone through the trouble of advising how to make the most out of this product.  I was so pleased with this product I purchased two more!,Y,N,,,
B003QKS4Z4,Does this gizmo work with LED lamps? Phillips LED lightbuld in particular.,Either I got a dud or this product doesn't work with LED bulbs although not sure why it wouldn't work with LED bulbs if that's the case; but either way this purchase was a waste of money in my case.UPDATE: it works just not behind glass.  Relocated to the back door (not behind glass) and it works great.  Worth buying.,Y,Y,,,
B003QKS4Z4,Does this gizmo work with LED lamps? Phillips LED lightbuld in particular.,I've had this gizmo in place for about one month and I thought I'd provide a report for those who want some details on performance.1.  This unit does NOT have a light sensor; that is it still turns on/off even in the daylight.  The product description is silent on this point my bad for not noticing.2.  The light stays on for about four minutes after activating; NOT adjustable.3.  Despite these quibbles I am pleased with the key factor: does it reliably sense movement at a reasonable distance?  YES.I needed to light a 3-car garage with a nine-foot ceiling.  There is already a duplex outlet in the ceiling; to test this unit I bought a simple adapterLeviton Mfg L10-00061-00I Ivory Outlet Adapter Bakelite Slimpakand plugged the whole thing in hoping the weight of this unit plus a bulb wouldn't simply fall out of the outlet.  So far so good (although I will admit to a safety string in case it comes loose).So performance: the light works reliably at a distance of 15 feet..... the situation is such that I can't test to see if it works any further away than that.  Interestingly it does not ALWAYS detect my German Shepherd but it triggers on humans of every size who are vertical.  The nine-foot ceiling may be the problem here.One other piece of info you won't find in the description.... the detection pattern is not completely circular .... it's shaped kind of like a figure-8 with a fat middle.  This unit is marked with two arrows 180 degrees apart indicating the direction of the longest range. My experience is that this unit triggers at 15-foot distance regardless of which way it's aimed.So now I'm going to install a permanent socket and get rid of that string.  Hope this information helps you.UPDATE: OK I've determined that the unit DOES reliably detect the German Shepherd but the range is about 10 feet.  I'm reasonably certain the range would be greater with an 8' ceiling.,Y,N,,,
B003QKS4Z4,Does this gizmo work with LED lamps? Phillips LED lightbuld in particular.,I'm using this sensor with an LED bulb PAR38 Dimmable LED Light Bulb 1200 Lumen 18W (85W) 3000K E26 Base and using it in a lamp base without the shade because we don't have an overhead bulb fixture and the ceiling is very high. The LED works perfectly with the sensor although we had to put the lamp base on the lower table since the sensor is designed to be facing down and didn't detect our movement when it was facing upward and placed on top of the refrigerator. Now the light comes on when we open the door from the house into the garage and turns off after 4 minutes of no movement.This provided a good solution to save on electricity. The four fluorescent bulbs plus ballasts probably took a lot more energy than the 18 watts that the LED bulb uses. Because we have a refrigerator in the garage we go out there fairly often and now we don't have to remember to turn the lights off. This sensor does it automatically for us.,Y,Y,,,
B003QKS4Z4,Does this gizmo work with LED lamps? Phillips LED lightbuld in particular.,The sensor works as advertised. Would be great for closets or other areas that are typically enclosed. Works well on my front porch which is roofed but open on one side. However a more convenient item for this particular application would have been one with an ambient light sensor so it would not turn the light on during the day. It is a bit long so in a 7 foot closet and a long bulb (like a CFL) it would hang down a bit on the low side perhaps even being in the way of upper shelves.,Y,N,,,

B001I9TI4Q,I have a vintage corrugated aluminium glass lens 2d flashlight will this fit?,It is not as bright as the latest Minimad LED or maglight factory LED but it is useful to extend the life of your d cell maglights. Buy a new maglight led otherwise.,N,N,,,
B001I9TI4Q,I have a vintage corrugated aluminium glass lens 2d flashlight will this fit?,The TerraLUX TLE-6EXB MiniStar5 140 Lumens Led Conversion Kit for 2-3 Cell C&D; MagLites is an excellent and cost effective upgrade to replace an incandescent bulb. I bought two of these bulbs and I am very happy with this purchase. After inserting the LED bulb into my MagLite I compared it with a MagLite that still contained an incandescent bulb and there was a significant improvement with the LED. The incandescent bulb gave off a weak dull yellowish light while the LED threw a much more powerful bright white light. There was really no comparison between the LED and the incandescent.Inserting the LED was very easy and can be completed within two minutes.1. Unscrew the flashlight head.2. Unscrew retaining collar and remove the incandescent bulb. Note: on one of my MagLites the retaining collar was on very tight and I needed to gently use a pair of pliers to loosen it.3. Insert the LED bulb into the socket.4. Screw the retaining collar back on.5. Replace the flashlight head.Simple and easy to upgrade to the LED bulb. When changing the bulb I also recommend that you take an extra 3-5 minutes to conduct basic maintenance on your MagLite. Remove the flashlight head and tailcap to clean the threads. It is not uncommon for dirt to get on the threads which can make turning the flashlight head difficult. Use a paper towel to wipe off any dirt or grime. I also recommend using a small amount of silicone based grease on the threads as a lubricant.Also remember that the MagLites will store an extra bulb in the tailcap. Do not throw away your incandescent bulb because you can use it as a backup bulb in case the LED malfunctions. Also following is a tip for those who will use this flashlight for camping or backpacking. The incandescent bulb can be used as a method for starting a fire if you don't have matches lighter firesteel or other means of lighting a fire. The way you do this is by breaking the glass on the bulb using caution not to break the bulbs filament. Now remove the flashlight head and insert the incandescent bulb back in the flashlight but do not replace the flashlight head. When you turn the light on the bulb filament will get hot and can ignite properly prepared tinder to start a fire.Overall I am very happy with the  TerraLUX LED conversion kit and will be purchasing more for my other MagLites.,N,N,,,
B001I9TI4Q,I have a vintage corrugated aluminium glass lens 2d flashlight will this fit?,I replaced the original Maglight bulb in my 2-D Cell Maglight flashlight. It was like a new flashlight! The light was noticeably brighter and whiter than the original incandescent bulb. And the battery drain is less so the batteries will last longer. It allows full use of the focusing capabilities of the Maglight.If you already own an older Maglight flashlight that still works this is a worthwhile upgrade for battery life and brightness for a bit less than buying a new LED Maglight flashlight. I hate throwing out perfectly good stuff so this was perfect for me.The Good:Great upgrade for light output over original incandescent bulb.Great upgrade for improved battery life when used for longer periods.Easy install.Needs Work:Price is too close to the cost of a new Maglight  LED flashlight needs to be lower.,N,N,,,
B001I9TI4Q,I have a vintage corrugated aluminium glass lens 2d flashlight will this fit?,I need to disclaim: I probably own 25 plus different LED flashlights. From the Uber Surefires to cheap $3 ebay ones.  I have played many hours in the dark with lights both with work & play (mostly play).  I am a member of several flashlight forums. I am what they call a flashaholic.I was looking to bring new life into my 20 plus year old 3 C Mag light that has been sitting in my tool box ever since the LED lights first came out. So one day at the store I saw the Niteize led drop in bulb for the Mag light.  I thought man what a cool idea to try. I had been looking to mod my Mag light anyway with minimum work. So I bought it.  I installed it and it was some what brighter than my original bulb. Even with fresh batteries it was a let down compared to my cheapest ebay LED. I had the bug and wanted more.So I found the TerraLUX.  The price is only a few bucks more than the Niteize LED. Wow is all I can say. It is superior deal to the Niteize junk.  Keep in mind you can still use the focus feature of your light.  This is cool.  There are only a few LED lights sold with focus. There are 2 other Mag Mods I plan on doing. One is the Bustacap tail end the other is a glass lens.  The plastic ones tend to scratch to easily. I think with these few mods you will breath new life into your old mag.Now I know you can get a brighter & smaller light cheaper than modding the old one. But mine is sorta sentimental to me. So why not.  So now I have brought my old Mag back into service. I like it in my vehicle. It gives great light & the 3C can be used as a last ditch self defense tool too. The smaller lights are nice but not much for smacking a knuckle head with if necessary.,N,N,,,
B001I9TI4Q,I have a vintage corrugated aluminium glass lens 2d flashlight will this fit?,I bought this to upgrade a MagLite with 3 D Cells.  There is a retaining ring that you have to unscrew on the flashlight and then you replace the bulb.  The bulb fits into a cylindrical sleeve.  The fit was so tight that initially I couldn't get it in and was thinking about returning the bulb.  I finally pushed very hard and forced it in.  It fit but just barely.  Once in it worked like a champ.,N,N,,,
B001I9TI4Q,I have a vintage corrugated aluminium glass lens 2d flashlight will this fit?,I would've given this a 5-star rating except for one little problem. If your 2-D cell maglite flashlight uses the newer type bulb which is like the little plug-in mini maglite type bulb that sits inside of a plastic adapter which is held in place with the screw-in metal collar be aware that the collar will NOT fit over this bulb.  I was kind of bummed because of this thinking I'd have to return it. But I got one of my older maglites that used the regular flashlight bulb and took that screw-in collar off and tried it on my newer maglite. Fortunately the thread used on both retainer collars is the same so when I tried it on this lamp it worked fine. Apparently the inside of the retainer collar is narrower with the newer style maglites so if you have an older conventional bulb style model this LED replacement will work fine. Great light output with longer battery life!,N,N,,,
B001I9TI4Q,I have a vintage corrugated aluminium glass lens 2d flashlight will this fit?,This LED lamp fit perfectly in my 3 cell MagLite.  its a bit brighter and has a whiter color than the incandescent bulb.  I expect the batteries will last longer due to better efficiency.,N,N,,,

Then I honestly recommend you get this keyless chuck replacement so you don't have to fuss around with the different size collets and the little collet wrench. You can quickly change out your drill bits grinding wheels cut off wheels wire brush etc with this keyless chuck.  Easy to do unscrew the collet cap remove the collet then screw this in place and you are done and ready to use this keyless chuck with any bit. Just insert bit hand tighten the chuck as you lock out the tip from rotating as you tighten and your done and ready to use.  I also have the Black and Decker rotary tool (I gave that rotary tool high marks too in one of my other reviews. )  This keyless chuck head screws right on to that Black and Decker Rotary tool easily.  With it you have made your Dremel/rotary tool  with this keyless chuck more of the reach for tool that it is without the hesitation and headaches of different size collets to switch out. This keyless chuck saves time when using your Dremel. It is worth it and you will never return to using the collet!!!,N,Y,,,

I checked double checked all of the batteries in the box to make sure that they were fully charged and they are.I have ordered these batteries from Streamlight in the past and will continue to order these same batteries in the future!Would recommend them to anyone who needs these batteries for a flashlight or optics system!,N,N,,,
B000IXCO8K,are these the same as the CR2 batteries.I need them for my viridian C5 laser,Great buy for the price.  These are the most expensive batteries but due to work I always need this size for my flashlights.  Not much to say they are just batteries but they came well packaged and very quick....  Good buy...,N,N,,,
B000IXCO8K,are these the same as the CR2 batteries.I need them for my viridian C5 laser,These work beautifully. Excellent for my surefire lights and streamlight.Best thing about this product is the price. A few dollars less than the surefire cells with the same level of power and use. Can't beat it.,N,N,,,
B003UCODIA,CAN YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OWN EYE GLASSES,A person kind of knows when they pay cheap they get cheap. I already anticipated this out of the gate. I don't used this type of tool often so that isn't a big issue. They are functional and good for finding microscopic slivers not easily seen by regular eyesight.,Y,N,,,
B003UCODIA,CAN YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OWN EYE GLASSES,not much to say other than it works the color is not the same as the picture but for doing small solder work it should come in handy,Y,N,,,
B003UCODIA,CAN YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OWN EYE GLASSES,No problems with this magnifier at all.  Works 100% great; however packaging has a lot left to be desired.  I sincerely do not know who to blame The shipper or the shipping company.The magnifier was completely out of the container.  The left  head screw will not hold it is stripped.I did not want to complain and go through the hassle of sending back & forth.The magnification is stupendous utilized in three different categories which is extremely helpful.AnthonyBurlington MA.,Y,N,,,
B003UCODIA,CAN YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OWN EYE GLASSES,Bad eyesight in one eye and this fixed that when messing with my watches or any other eye straining stuff. Well priced and with care should last a long time.,Y,N,,,
B003UCODIA,CAN YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OWN EYE GLASSES,I have a pair of relatively simplistic Magnifiers that I have been using for a variety of things including electronics projects. They were okay but I had to wear a light on my head above the magnifier and then if I wanted to look at something without them I would have to take off the light take off the magnifier and then put on my reading glasses.  Then if I wanted to see something really close I would get out my loupe and look at whatever I was working on with them.  It was a very cumbersome process. This simplifies everything so much I can't get over it. There are two level of magnification.  Of course the light is built in and there is a loupe attached for really close work.  Then if you want to look at something without magnification you just flip up the lens portion. Then when you want magnification you flip it down again.  You can move the loupe in and out of you field of vision easily also.  One person felt that these were tight on the forehead.  It didn't seem that way to me but then what I was using was much less comfortable than these.  Believe me when I tell you I am very excited about this purchase.  These have made my life a lot easier.  I would highly recommend these to anyone.  You just can't do better than this for the price.  I've never been happier with a purchase.,Y,N,,,
B003UCODIA,CAN YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OWN EYE GLASSES,Not sure why my last review never showed up but I'll try again. These have helped me a bunch with small projects. While I don't think these may be an all day comfort style head magnifier I certainly can't complain here. I was not sure how good these would be but I'm very satisfied with these for the money. Quality tested by the mail carrier besides he was not kind to them and too lazy to walk 5 feet more in order to set them on my porch instead he tossed them there.  Now; there contained a soft cover book over an inch thick smashing on top of them and they didn't break so the plastic seems tough for sure.,Y,N,,,
B003UCODIA,CAN YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OWN EYE GLASSES,I really like these and should probably order a couple more sets for around the house and back in the shop. When you need them they are there. Bright clear and the extra eye piece really lets you focus in on your work.,Y,N,,,
B003UCODIA,CAN YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OWN EYE GLASSES,Works as it should and the  small eye magnifier easily relocates on the other side. Only down side to this unit is that as much as I would push the magnifier up and over the head it would not stay there. Everytime I moved my head the thing would fall over my eyes again. Tried tightening it to no avail.,Y,N,,,
B003UCODIA,CAN YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OWN EYE GLASSES,Works well for soldering and doing some fine electronics work.  Have gotten used to wearing them and they work great the only downside is that the 'flip down lens' is a little bit funky to do while wearing them and is not going to hold up to repeated use (not a huge issue for me as I'll leave them down).  Fits over my large frame glasses just fine.  If your going to use these every day they may not stand up well (I'm a bit hard on things) but for periodic/recreational/hobby/intermittent use they should work just fine!,Y,Y,,,
B003UCODIA,CAN YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OWN EYE GLASSES,For the price i thought it wouldn&#8217;t be a great magnifier but i was really surprised that it actually works pretty well.I wear glasses so i was concerned that i couldn&#8217;t use them but it fits over them without a problem.The band is a little uncomfortable to wear but some padding really helps might also be my smallish head.The magnifiers aren&#8217;t the best quality and suffer from fringing but for the price....its not bad.,Y,N,,,
B000IXAJVY,Stupid question but I am at a loss. I believe the batteries go in one end of the flashlight but I can not get it opened. Is that where they go?,We have had this for five years and it's still working most excellently.  It's bright heavy and solid.  What more do you need!,Y,N,,,

B000IXAJVY,Stupid question but I am at a loss. I believe the batteries go in one end of the flashlight but I can not get it opened. Is that where they go?,O.k. I just bought 2 more 3-d black LED version ST3016 3-D one for me and one for a friend. I already own one. Why the friend will be explained below. In any case there was no black spot in the middle when focused at the most narrow focus position on the one I bought.I had the chance to take the pepsi challenge between the LED version and the same normal 3-d mag light a friend of mine owns because he accidentially bought the old none-led version. At over 1 mile away I could make out in a field clearly a cow (black and white). My friend with the normal mag light could not even reach the cow so that we could see that there was a cow in the field at all. Not even the outline of something.There has been some discussion about the merits of this light as a defensive weapon. I would invite all those that question if it is usefull as a defensive weapon to please come to my house and let me night blind you with it and wack you over the head with 3+ pounds of metal and batteries. Chances are we will have a discussion about how good it felt either at the intensive care unit or the morge. It will easily collapse your scull and I have yet to use it on a person that was even ready for being blinded by it that could function a few seconds after having it shined in their eyes.Is it a 12 gauge shotgun effective form of defense? No. Is it better than standing with only your junk in your hand in the dark effective defense? most definitly the answer is yes! I would take this over a can of pepper spray knive or even club.My only complaint if it is a complaint is that I do feel some play in the button. Totally still works just I believe that is from using the button to slightly turn it on turn it off rather than a full click. Saves batteries in exchange. battiers are easy 72 hours of full force about a month of nightly use for a few mins before the batteries start loosing their force. I ran it two weeks past that 72 hour peek on the same set of batteries and it was still way more than usefull for say another 100 hours. Just full power needed a fresh set.,Y,N,,,
B000IXAJVY,Stupid question but I am at a loss. I believe the batteries go in one end of the flashlight but I can not get it opened. Is that where they go?,Another nice Maglite product.  Takes three D Cell batteries.  Very powerful beam.  Beam width is adjustable as with most Maglite products.  The LED beam is very bright.  I believe it's much brighter than a standard bulb flashlight.  Flashlight is heavy and could be used for self protection if the need arises.  Very pleased with this purchase.,Y,N,,,
B000IXAJVY,Stupid question but I am at a loss. I believe the batteries go in one end of the flashlight but I can not get it opened. Is that where they go?,"I did not buy one from Amazon. However where I work (airport security) you need a good reliable flashlight at night. Okay so this one uses less power but the LED is not changeable when it breaks down (drop it a few times and it WILL die then what? - Get a new flashlight instead of replacing the LED ""bulb""... then you get left with scrap aluminum to use as clubs?) AND I don't care what anybody sayes it does not focus as well or throw light as far as the first generation version with the changeable LED ""bulb"" also used as an upgrade. (They were hitting their stride when they released those.) I dazzled everybody that was using the new ones by showing them my old one and we tested side by side. Never did any of the new generation LED Mag-lites measure up ot my old first generaion LED Mag-Lite. Sorry but that is the truth. Now with this second generation unreliable and not as bright (technically they say it is brighter but in practice at the airport it does not do the job as well as the previous model) we will no longer be buying Mag-lites. Yes they are on their way out of use by professionals that need good flashlights. Many are buying Stingers and LED LENSERS. (I think the more even and precise light you get from the older 3-watt ones makes it light up things at a greater distance and more evenly than the supposedly brighter 2-watt lopsided focus fixed LED version now sold.) Now we have to spend more money for what is as good as the first generation Mag-lite LED flashlights WERE. Personally I like the rounder more focused light I get from it too although I have switched to LED LENSER for the most part I still use my 3 cell first gen and it has outlasted 2 others that are second generation. My advice to you is get something else and it pains me to say that given Mag-lite's history with law enforcement and such. My direct replacement that is far superior and consequently more expensive it the LED lesner P17. With that one you cannot go wrong. It is just not AS waterproof as a Mag-lite (don't submurge it but it is fine in the rain) but what can you do. My older 3-watt Mag-lite with the replaceable LED ""bulb"" (an advantage over the LED LENSER) is still going strong and it is several YEARS older than the new ones (and none of them are working as of today.) Until they go back to the older quality get something else ANYTHING else. (try a Brinkmann Legend for a higher quality replacement) I am so very disappointed with the way Mag-lite went with this. I hope they wake up before they become a joke and get something practical. Bottom line for us is: In security and law enforcement it HAS to work. These don't do the job well enough - any more. Too bad.",Y,N,,,
B000IXAJVY,Stupid question but I am at a loss. I believe the batteries go in one end of the flashlight but I can not get it opened. Is that where they go?,Without a doubt this is the best flashlight you can own.Can't believe how bright it is.

B000IXAJVY,Stupid question but I am at a loss. I believe the batteries go in one end of the flashlight but I can not get it opened. Is that where they go?,"Worked great with no problems until the battery leaked.  This is more my fault probably but when I check on the MagLite Web page they had battery leakage listed under their ""FAQs"".  That leads me to believe it is a recurring issue.  My Mag Lite was purchased on December 18 2007.  I just opened it up and discovered the batteries had not only leaked I could not get them out of the case to even attempt replacing them or identifying them to file a claim with the battery maker (as MagLite suggests in their FAQs).  I will be pitching this in the trash.Here's my hint: Open your MagLite up every year or so and take the batteries out for a visual inspection. Probably a good idea for any flashlight.  Do it when you're replacing your smoke alarm batteries...",Y,N,,,

B002RT7K4Q,do you have a 14.4 impact  bare tool ?,i grew up on construction sites and i have a shopping problem when it comes to tools.  i can't believe it took me this long to add this to my collection.  i've only had it a few weeks and it's more than earned it's keep so far.  I'll list a pro/con.PROs: no more stripping heads of screws short and fits in places drills will not insane power for being a small cordless tool impact tool so it will drive when drills & screwdrivers can't variable speed trigger (torque drops and speed raises) can replace drill and cordless screwdrivers so many bits available that you can do an amazing amount of work with this thing it's small so it is super easy to carry on you.CONs: it's almost perfect so this is hard...if i could change one thing i would like an adjustable torque so that the speed wasn't tied inversely to the torque.  when you want to slow down to get a screw set just right that jacks up the torque and you might set it a little lower than you would like.  you won't strip screw heads but you can easily strip the material the screw is going into.  this thing is so powerful you start thinking it can replace your impact wrench.  that will work on small stuff but don't expect this tiny cordless tool to do the job of a good 1/2&#34; plug-in impact wrench.,N,N,,,
B002RT7K4Q,do you have a 14.4 impact  bare tool ?,"I live in New Zealand and was delighted to find that I could get bare DeWalt tools via Amazon alot cheaper (on special) even when airfreight is taken into account.What isnt explained on the Amazon site (I couldn't see it) but appears on the box the tool came in is that this tool will also work with some Li-Ion batteries and I quote ""Tool works with DeWalt18 Volt NiCd or Li-Ion Batteries"". Now to me thats an important piece of information.The Tool arrived just before Xmas and in time to do an extreme amount of work fixing battens to my tunnel house - about 400 x 50mm hex screws in one day and one battery charge- which it did with the greatest of ease. When it comes to screws I have found in the short time I have had the tool that the extra hard bits ie those designedfor the impact tool are well worth the extra money the normal ones just dont keep there shape. Its light weight was helpful when working over head height. I was a little concernedabout the weird smell coming from the motor but as time wore on the smell decreased and has now almost gone. When selecting tools for overseas delivery select very carefullyas a mistake (I selected and had sent the 1/2"" impact wrench by mistake) can cost dearly in return post and in time.",N,N,,,
B002RT7K4Q,do you have a 14.4 impact  bare tool ?,"I'm not a huge Dewalt Tool Fan but it's what I started with (an initial 18-volt set I must maintain) nor  do I imply they're the best brand.This Bare Tool DC825B is my latest addition.About It:90-Day Money Back a 1-Year Free Service Contract and a 3-Year limited Warranty - that's above average CS for sure.""Made in Mexico""; 1/4"" (6mm) Impact Driver Type 3 18v DC is variable speed based on trigger pull @ 0-2400 RPM with 0-2700 impacts per minute;  Magnesium gearset and tranny; user replaceable Motor Brushes; weighs only 2.2lbs (bare tool);  yields 1330 Inch Pounds = 111 Foot lbs - alot for a cordless tool of its compact size.Lots of torque for size but with a downside - torque's not fully controllable.  Albeit small this Impact Driver has wallop I can easily over torque smaller size fastener.  Now by design  my amount of trigger pull does control RPM/IPM so its torque (speed too) is somewhat controllable.  Additionally Dewalt has a Cutch/Torque Attachment P/N DWHJHLD - not sure how good it is however...It's a Quick Disconnect (QD) & Connect feature of a Cylindered Collet Slip Ring.  Insertion of Hex bit does not require movement of Ring just clicks in place with a push and locks firmly into position.  Its Collet Slip Ring 'spring loaded' to locked position is only required to be pulled forward upon Hex bit removal then snaps back into locked position - quite neat design.Does have 'burnt electrical' smell for a while during first many uses (mine did).  This annoyance could be different between new and rebuilt units not sure - yet could explain varying reviews same topic.  Its 'burnt electrical' smell will dissipate once broken-in (mine did) a length of time hedged on usage.  In my case odor began to dissipate within three weeks of daily use.Battery life with a 3-4 y/o 18v XRP brick is good to excellent.Accepts 1/4"" Hex bits/drills; 1/4"" Hex to ratchet-type square drives and 1/4"" Universal Hex to whatever.Is a light bare tool yet battery attachment near doubles its weight as expected.I will strip head of a cross-tip (Phillip's head) fastener in blink of eye if not applying enough force to fastener head happens frequently.  If utilizing fasteners with Torx head hex head 12-pt head internal wrenching I'll not experience such head stripping.  I'll go further and opine it's rare to strip head of fastener other than cross-tip however it'll snap heads off easily especially smaller type fasteners size #10 and smaller.Before I forget a good quality 'Impact Bit' is similar in makeup as impact sockets...Try to locate those which claim forged (should say so on packaging) vs cast/machined also be wary of 'cold forging' and note the higher their Carbon content the better.  Impact sockets/bits are generally coated with black oxide and easy to distinguish but be wary of low carbon content machined or cast knockoffs painted black.If building a Deck wood Playhouse performing repetitive fastening of nature this Driver will be your friend.  I recommend TORX head-type fastener deck screws if building a deck or similar project and intend to use heavy-duty size steel/weatherproof Deck Screw fasteners.  Torx head deck screws are a bit more pricey but to me they're well worth extra cost.If planning to drive Lag Bolt fasteners 5/16"" or greater shank diameter and more than a ~ 4 inches in length such for heavy treated timbers - landscaping/fence type I recommend searching for a more robust Impact Driver.  The DC825 will handle most common heavy-duty Deck Screws with ease but does not perform well driving 5/16"" X 6"" or larger lags without drilling pilot holes.In closing if searching for a drill which will serve more than singular purpose of Impact Dewalt and other equally reputable brands have many other Drills offering multiple features which will satisfy broad application.This cordless Impact Driver DC825 I find serves well as a light-to medium-duty Impact Driver.KR",N,N,,,
B002RT7K4Q,do you have a 14.4 impact  bare tool ?,I already own XRP tools charger and batteries. Bare tools are a great way to add what you actually need or to replace. The tool is compact light weight and very well balanced to use. It has great torque for its size and really puts screws in fast and easy without effort. Should have bought one earlier I'll never use a drill for driving again. Received exactly what was advertised. I ordered thru Amazon from Bestcutleryandcookware and mysteriously received an email confirmation from Helton & Co. I was a  little puzzled about my order neverless everything was perfect.,N,N,,,
B002RT7K4Q,do you have a 14.4 impact  bare tool ?,A powerhouse and a great value for me as a bare tool since I have several other tools that use the same batteries. This is a replacement for my old (old) 9.6-V DeWalt impact driver which has served me well but has nowhere near the power of this model. Little things like the belt clip option the ability to stand the tool up on the bench on its battery (the old one falls over) and the very high power-to-weight ratio make this tool superb. Looking forward to using it on every project I do!,N,N,,,
B002RT7K4Q,do you have a 14.4 impact  bare tool ?,"I couldn't be happier with this DeWalt Impact Driver DC825B got the bare tool as I have lots of  unused cases littering the garage and quite a few batteries from all the other DeWalt Cordless Tools I have acquired over the years.I was impressed from the very first screws that I drove with this tool 4"" square drive deck screws into a tough old gnarly 4x4 it has plenty of power and the screws just disappeared into the wood with a constant speed with no bogging down. Also it has an LED to illuminate the work area if you use it in a low light situation a very nice addition.  It is compact lightweight and has a comfortable grip all important factors for extended use.I would recommend this tool to anyone who drives a lot of screws. This is not a one tool does all tool as it does not have an adjustable chuck like the cordless drills but a quick disconnect speed load chuck this is a thing to keep in mind if you can only afford one tool this is not for you but on the other hand if you want the best tool for the job and that is stuffing long screws into hard wood go for this little beauty you will not be sorry.",N,N,,,

B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,We tried several brands and found them unreliable until we got this one. This one works great and has good range. It's also very loud if you turn it up. Highly recommended!,Y,N,,,
B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,I live in a house with a wall around the property and a gate that is some distance from the front door. Wiring a bell to the gate would be possible but quite inconvenient.  The reason I bought this particular chime is because it claims a operational range greater than most on the market and I needed the range.Training the push button to the chime is as simple as pushing a button on the base unit and then pressing the push button itself.While the Honeywell chime is a bit more expensive than others the materials and apparent quality are well above average.  Installation is a snap and the operational range is more than adequate for my needs.,Y,N,,,
B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,Fairly easy to assemble.  With the volume all the way up I can hear it from anywhere in the house.  Since it's portable I can also put it on the back deck when I'm working in the back yard.  I just left it on the standard ding-dong but it does have a couple other sound options.  You can also buy an additional push button(s) for other doors and an icon will blink showing you which door rung.  When you mount the push button you'll need to use a drill to get thru the plastic and wood for the tiny screws that hold it in place.,Y,N,,,

B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,Bought this unit to replace a GE 19209 wireless door chime that I purchased in February which didn't last more than a few months. We installed this Honeywell chime by the front door with the push button at the back door. We also purchased an additional push button which is installed in our driveway approximately 40-45 feet from the chime. Both push buttons work fine. I did also purchase outlet covers to go over the push buttons to protect them from rain. I thought that might've been part of the problem with the GE unit but not sure since alot of other reviewers for the GE unit also had issues with it. So far I've been happy with the performance of this unit just hope it holds up.,Y,N,,,
B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,Got it to replace my old Heath Zenith wireless door chime.  So far so good.Both the front door button and the rear door button (I bought an extra button) were able to reach the base just fine.  While my old ones had trouble.  It looks better and more sophisticated than HZ and with more functions.  Although the manual was terrible.  It is cryptic for me try to configure the sounds for my buttons.  Took a few trial and errors.Due to the house structure one of the door buttons have to be mounted with exposure to weather.  I shall hold my breath to see how it fairs under the intense southern california sun and occasional downpour.  I wonder if I should use my silicone sealant to further seal it.,Y,Y,,,
B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,Ordered this for the same reason most folks do to install a doorbell without having wiring available.  When I found this on Amazon it looked higher end than most doorbells.  Sleek silver housing with a smoke black cover and a nice-looking push button.  I was a bit disappointed as soon as I opened the package.  The doorbell chime housing itself was much fatter than I was expecting but ah well.  But the plastic on this is not &#34;Premium&#34; so maybe something else is.First I needed to get it open to install 3 &#34;AA&#34; batteries.  To do this you have to depress and slide a flimsy black button while pulling the smoke black cover towards you.  Which means you are pushing one direction (the button) while trying to pull another (the slide).  Genius.  After a few minutes I finally got the batteries installed and moved on to the push button.So the push button just takes one CR-style battery.  Here again is where I wondered if those who designed the products actually ever used the products...even once.  To get the two halves of the push button apart you have to insert a flat blade screwdriver and pry them apart.  This is admittedly easier once the back half is securely mounted to a surface.  But when you're just holding the smallish button in your hand you can easily gouge the plastic and/or your hand trying to get this thing apart.  Here I wonder about how many times it will take a battery replacement before the unit starts to look bad from prying it apart or not snapping back together tightly.  Once I got it apart I inserted the battery but noticed there is no weather proofing inside the push button housing.Maybe the push button housing snaps together tightly enough to prevent water entry but who knows.  I know as the main button for the doorbell they can sometimes be mounted in locations exposed to the weather as was our case.  Only a few good rainstorms will tell but I'm wondering about the long-term prospects of this push button.Overall once I got everything ready the doorbell chime selections are few but good and the volume control (another really cheap feature) allows you to adjust the volume to suit your tastes.  I do wish it had a push button feature to turn it down in case you have a baby asleep etc but you can just slide the center cover back and turn it down if you wish.We paired a second push button to this unit and it worked just fine.  So it works as a wireless doorbell as intended but I was a bit disappointed in the quality and execution of the unit.,Y,N,,,
B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,My wife is 9 months pregnant this week.  She had a difficult time early in the pregnancy so we bought this early on so that she could easily get my attention if needed.  We have a small house but it is pretty sound proof when trying to communicate between upstairs and down.  This works perfectly.  She keeps the button with her or near her all the time and I can hear it go off anywhere in the house.  I use it when I am outside and she is inside.  I have concerns with the button unit being exposed to weather if it was mounted outside.  If it was on a covered porch it would be fine.  No problems with transmission or sound of the doorbell at all.  Works great for what we use it for!,Y,Y,,,

B00009LI4K,Can I sleep in them?,For the price these things are great.  I just purchased my second pair. For double the price they are still great!  I use them for both woodworking and pistol shoot at the range.  The indoor range can get quite LOUD ... especially with large rifles next door to you.  These earmuffs do a great job of cutting the noise.  It is difficult to hear a conversation next to you but for that there are more expensive models.  For what I need at this time these work great.  Comfort is also a plus.  I can wear them for hours and don't feel a thing.  Definitely recommended.,N,N,,,
B00009LI4K,Can I sleep in them?,I can wear these and so can my two kids ages 8 and 10.  However the head set is too small to comfortably fit my husband's head.  There doesn't seem to be a way to adjust them.  If they don't fit right out of the box then you might can't use them.I took them with me to go shotgun shooting way out in the boonies and they really kept the sound out of my ears.  I am female and have an average head size and they were very comfortable for me to wear.  Also I use these to read while the rest of the family watches T.V. in the same room.  I like to be with them but don't necessarily like to watch the same things on T.V.  Besides I like to read and these allow me to read and not be distracted by sounds coming from the T.V. set.They seem to be well constructed and I expect them to last for several years.  They really do a great job of blocking out sound.  I have to lift one side off my ear so I can hear when somebody wants to talk to me.,N,N,,,
B00009LI4K,Can I sleep in them?,I was seriously surprised at the decible loss that these cans delivered.  I got them delivered to my office and immeadiatly used them to tune out my coworkers.  If somebody is talking directly to you in a normal voice you can still hear them albit barley. They block out all ambiant noise.  These are a really nice for my home rennovation project.  Easy to tak on and off easy to adjust and hard to miss if you set them down.,N,N,,,
B00009LI4K,Can I sleep in them?,I shopped around a lot I wasn't able to find anything better than this. This could serve many purposes for shooting working around heavy machinery etc. Personally I use them because I have a noise sensitivity which makes it hard for me to do certain tasks like vacuuming the house or focus on doing something when loud noises are present. These are a good coping mechanism for that but if you're buying them for this purpose it's important to NOT wear them all the time only when you need to. Wearing them constantly will make the problem worse.When I first put them on it seemed like they did not fit. There are actually expansion bars in the headband the wires leading from the headband to the earmuffs can extend out from the headband. It takes a little force to get them to do so and then they will fit(very snugly.) I wear glasses and wearing these over them isn't immediately uncomfortable.,N,N,,,
B00009LI4K,Can I sleep in them?,These things fit amazingly.  I can wear them for hours without any discomfort.  If the fiance comes down to talk to me then i can just slip them up above my ears and they can rest there comfortably (though if you move around too much they may fall).  One great feature of these compared to the folding variety is that they retain your height settings after you take them off.  The collapsing ones lose the setting every time and take longer to unfold to place onto your head.  I highly recommend these earmuffs since they're cheap but still work great.,N,N,,,
B00009LI4K,Can I sleep in them?,"I won't reiterate what others have said but just make a couple pertinent points:You're likely comparing (and if not you should) this Peltor headset along with the top=of-the-line Bilsom: the Bilsom Thunder T3 is the best constructed headphone/ear protection I own. A have several by Peltor and the one most comparable to the T3 is the Peltor H10A. The Peltor is not as well made; the over-head piece on the T3 is much better--it actually clicks into place and does not move. The Peltors are all wire and move easily. I would say if many people are going to use same headset (such as different shifts at a worksite) Peltor might be better as it's easily adjusted by just sliding on the wire. The T3 are better at a single set for your head size and it does not move.The Peltor H10A might actually be a tad more comfortable for my head hat size at 7 3/4. The T3 is tight and cannot be adjusted out for looseness. I'd rather wear the Peltor H10A for a protracted period of time than the Bilsom T3. If my head were smaller I think the T3 would be fine.The Bilsom T3 blocks sound better than any Peltor I have owned (I have owned about three models of Peltors). It's as simple as that.Both have because of the larger ear cup size (compared to lower profile usually less protective for hearing models) the ability to keep your head straight when dozing on an airplane. You know how people use the cervical neck pillow U-shaped things so they won't kink their neck to one side when they sleep on a plane? Well you won't need that with a high-profile larger cup size sound protection like these---they stick out from your head enough that you will sleep with head straight ahead regardless. This is a ""plus"". And no need the lousy ""noise cancellation"" headsets for six times the price plus batteries to charge etc. These are great for air flight.The Bilsom T3 is slightly wider on each ear cup than the Peltor H10A. Both however are not good to wear around your neck when not in use. The ear cups are too large and they will hit your chin. If you plan to wear and remove to ""dangle"" around your neck like a rifleman might you;d better stick with the lower-profile ""shooter"" type headsets...these are too wide. They will hit your chin unless you have a super long neck.The weight of each is about the same. I'd give the nod to the Bilsom for sound protection capability and quality of build (the wire overhead piece on Peltors can get stretched or bent--no chance with Bilsom) over the Peltor high-end models having owned both. But with my head size at 7 3/4 and certainly if your noggin is larger than mine you'd better stick with Peltor. The wire can be bent to accomodate the jumbo cranium better than Bilsom. Thanks.",N,N,,,
B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,Fast way to disconnect and reconnect things from the Dremel Tool.Allows you to connect more accessories quickly and securely.It was shipped quickly and got to me early.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,Simple and easy to use.  Lets you change bits withoutany tools.  Does not let you use any bits larger than thestandard Dremel Chuck does don't let the picture misleadyou.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,Personally I think it's a bit on the price side but the real disappointment comes after repeated use.  Especially on uses where there is side loading or any chatter but chuck quickly loosens up.  There have been many applications where no matter how hard I tighten the chuck the bit comes loose after literally 10 seconds or less.  In these cases I have given up and used the collet.  I have two of these and the problem seems to get worse over time making the product proportionally more expensive due to its short lifespan.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,If you have a Dremel MultiPro this inexpensive accessory will most certainly simplify things for you. Definitely a must have!,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,This small and inexpensive item is so versitile and makes your Dremel far more useful. After you use your Dremel with it you will wonder how you got by without it!It works just like any other keyless chuck on a larger drill it's all metal and holds tiny bits tightly and also holds the 1/8th inch bits well too. No wrench needed just give it a nice snugging by hand and it's good to go! It makes bit changing fast and easy and it also lets you put any size tiny drill bit into the Dremel with ease. All the way to zero no bit is too small. I have found that it takes a lot less effort to get it tight enough than I was used to it only takes a good snug twist to hold all bits well you don't have to use excessive force for it to hold. It also fits on the end of the flex shaft attachment or right angle attachment. It's such a time saver in bit changes you will quickly come to love it and wonder why the Dremel doesn't come with one in the first place! It will not fit in all accessories but for most of your Dremel work it's indespensible. I love mine! A must have item!,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,I havent used this yet but I am sure that it will be a nice change to using the original one that was shipped with the tool.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,this is a great chuck it works well with all my drill bits and Dremel tools.. if you need to drill a really small hole this will get you there..,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,this is a must have to remove bits in and out of your dremel.  seems like it will hold up.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,These should be standard on any Dremel tool instead of the collets that come that accept a limited shaft size.If you are only using the Dremel tools with a standard shaft size the collet will work &#34;okay&#34;.  But if you plan to drill with various size bits this is a must have item.Once you put this on your tool and it takes only a few minutes to do it you will never take it off as it does everything that a full set of collets will do without the hassle of changing them to match the tool shaft.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,this Accessory is a great help when you need change repeatly your bits I improve the model (Dremel 400-6/90 400 Series XPR Variable Speed Rotary Tool) with this one,Y,N,,,
B000EJ332O,Is it normal for it to come with no packaging? (Mine just came in a padded envelope with no box wrapper etc.),my title says it all----this was ordered and shipped arrived in perfect condition. cannot say much more about amazons service. perfect,N,Y,,,
B000EJ332O,Is it normal for it to come with no packaging? (Mine just came in a padded envelope with no box wrapper etc.),This will detect voltage in an outlet only if you stick it into the positive slot of the outlet.  It has been unable to detect live wires in a light outlet.,N,N,,,
B000EJ332O,Is it normal for it to come with no packaging? (Mine just came in a padded envelope with no box wrapper etc.),I use this whenever doing electrical work around the house - it's never let me down. Top tip - always test it on a known live before checking whatever it is you're working on - that way if the tool fails (or if you forget to turn it on) you won't be caught quite literally red-handed.,N,N,,,
B000EJ332O,Is it normal for it to come with no packaging? (Mine just came in a padded envelope with no box wrapper etc.),"Fluke makes well thought out and manufactured products for tradespeople all over the world. I have come to know the Fluke name over the years and find everything they make dependable and professional. I would test a circuit with a multimeter or contact test before handling it if you aren't positive about the circuit layout first. All of these non contact volt testers present a shock hazard if not verified with contacting testers first. They do a wonderful job of getting a quick ""hot"" or not feedback.",N,N,,,
B000EJ332O,Is it normal for it to come with no packaging? (Mine just came in a padded envelope with no box wrapper etc.),I first saw this tool being used on that home improvement show Holmes on Holmes.  Mike Holmes was testing all this substandard wiring and figuring out that a lot of it was live when it shouldn't be using this tool.I am no Mike Holmes I'm just an experienced do-it-yourself guy but I have done a LOT of electrical work over the years including all the electrical work in a full gut kitchen remodel a full gut bathroom remodel and so on.  I have had my electrical  work inspected and permitted multiple times without incident so I do know how to do basic household wiring correctly.The only time I ever got shocked in all that time was in a situation where the original wiring was done wrong.  They ran two separate circuits through the same ordinary light switch box.  Who would do something that stupid?  Apparently somebody.  I shut off the circuit I was planning to work on without incident but the other circuit in the box was still live and I didn't know it.  Fortunately it was just a 15Amp circuit and so this was more unpleasant than anything else but it was a nice reminder that even when you do know what you are doing you don't know whether the guy who came before you had the same skills you have.  In another house I lived in I figured out that the guy before me actually had two circuits feeding the same outlet (I called in a pro on that one IMMEDIATELY) but you just never know what crazy stuff you might find.This is a great tool to keep you safe from all that kind of stuff.  You just wave it near a wire and it tells you the wire is hot with a tone and a bright light.  The thing I like about it is that the end of the probe is shaped like one blade of an electrical plug so it slips into the socket and then the pen will stay there continually making a sound as long as the outlet is hot.  That is incredibly handy in trying to figure out whether you have the right breaker or not.It is also a Fluke which is one of the most respected brands in electronics/electrical testing.  This is a high quality product that works reliably every time I've used it.Do yourself a favor -- buy this and use it every time before you do any electrical work.  It will help to keep you safe -- it is a crazy world out there.  We all know that not everybody who does electrical work should do electrical work.  There is a lot of scary unsafe substandard stuff out there.  Don't get yourself hurt or killed because you couldn't be bothered to buy this and take 5 seconds to wave it at something you are about to work on that you &#34;know&#34; is safe.  It is really a no-brainer to buy this and use it every time.  I never do electrical work without it now.,N,N,,,
B000EJ332O,Is it normal for it to come with no packaging? (Mine just came in a padded envelope with no box wrapper etc.),I love this tool. But yesterday I encountered something I want to share with other potential buyers. I was under my house to check a faulty circuit and it was really humid: probably 100% relative humidity. Anyway I turned on my Fluke and started moving it from wire to wire to make sure it was working. Nothing. No beep no constant light. So what's wrong? When I got back out and went into the garage I tested it on an exposed wire running into an outlet box. Sure enough it beeped and the light came on. So what gives? Well I did a little research and the specs indicate it only works up to 95% relative humidity. Who would have guessed. Anyway this is a minor drawback to me and I'd rate it 4.75 if I could.,N,N,,,
B000EJ332O,Is it normal for it to come with no packaging? (Mine just came in a padded envelope with no box wrapper etc.),I had to troubleshoot an electric baseboard heater in a new house I just moved into. Of course the breaker box isn't labeled correctly due to upgrades over the last 30 years so I had no idea which breaker to use.  I also ordered a clamp meter but it's jaws were too big to get into the space where the wiring came into the heater.  I used the voltage tester to assist with finding the correct breaker (constant red go flip a breaker no constant red bingo found it) and verify when the thing had power restored to it. Turned out to be a broken thermostat connection and the heater was fine and all is repaired safely (and the circuit breaker is now properly labeled.,N,N,,,
B000EJ332O,Is it normal for it to come with no packaging? (Mine just came in a padded envelope with no box wrapper etc.),I keep this in the top pocket of my work vest which has my most frequently used tools.  That way I have no excuse for not checking wires before I touch them.  I only do little jobs like replacing fixtures switches etc around the house.  But still this is a wonderful item to have for safety and convenience.,N,N,,,
B000EJ332O,Is it normal for it to come with no packaging? (Mine just came in a padded envelope with no box wrapper etc.),I purchased this item instead of others because it's a Fluke and I know I can trust it to work and work properly. Using it is easy and the flashing light to indicate proper function is a welcomed feature. The audible beeper can be turned off but I don't do that. It's nice that it comes with batteries and that they are AAA which are easy to come by anywhere. However opening the device to change them is a little difficult. The reason I gave it four stars and not five is that it takes a bit long to sense live wires. Sticking it in an outlet is faster but putting it against a wire takes a bit longer. It definitely isn't a near instant response. Also as others mentioned the item I received was not in any sort of packaging. Not a box or clamshell. It was just a plastic bag with the device and instructions in it and an Amazon sticker describing the product. A little strange. I saw no indication of where it is made.,N,N,,,
B000EJ332O,Is it normal for it to come with no packaging? (Mine just came in a padded envelope with no box wrapper etc.),It just works. I use this constantly for doing minor electical work. I have been zapped enough times over the years by circuits I THOUGHT were off. This is also great for trouble shooting breaks in wires etc.,N,N,,,
B0009CEKY6,Does it come with a filter?,I can't tell much difference in taste but that's because my taste buds suck.  Everyone else in my family thinks this works great.  Have been using for over a year and replace the filters about every 3 months.,Y,N,,,
B0009CEKY6,Does it come with a filter?,These are ok...they look good and the water taste is much better than unfiltered.  Seems like they last a year or so and break...this is about the third I've had.  Not very well made.,Y,N,,,
B0009CEKY6,Does it come with a filter?,i love the way this makes my gnarly tap water taste. thanks to this little baby and a stainless steel i don't buy bottled water anymore.filters last a fair amount of time installation of unit and filters is easy.,Y,N,,,
B0009CEKY6,Does it come with a filter?,"i already have pretty good water where i live but this one definitely removes the ""tappy"" taste. i didn't think it took up more space than the newer horizontal-mount filters but my faucet curves high. i also like the vertical one better because the horizontal one has a battery to monitor when one should change the filter meaning the unit may need to be replaced in 5 years. so i went with the classic vertical one.the missing star is from a slight leak when the water is being filtered. mine is installed without any adapters. my water pressure seems too much for filter so it does leak from where the unit attaches to the faucet when i have the water on full blast. the leak isn't prominent (if any) when the water pressure isn't too strong.i really like this unit and would highly recommend it.",Y,N,,,
B0009CEKY6,Does it come with a filter?,We've been using a Brita faucet mounted filter system for a few years now and were on our third one when we gave this a try.TASTE: Both filter water straight out of the tap beautifully and since I'm not a professional reviewer who is going to benefit one way or the other I wont attempt to act like I know or even give a damn about the difference in flavor--just so long as it keeps chlorine out of my coffee.MOUNTING/INSTALLING: The key difference is the mount.  I can't imagine why anybody would design the mount the way that Brita has when they've got the opportunity to improve upon tradition.  The Brita system gives you a plastic piece that screws into the tap--as it must--but then you screw the system onto the adapter in the same way.  It's not that I mind the lack of innovation; it's the fact that it simply doesn't stay on the adapter very well causing it to leak and on occassion spray water all over my small kitchen before falling off onto our expensive dishes (no breakage yet but the unit is certainly heavy enough to shatter a glass or teacup).  Obviously threaded screw on plastic parts do not work very well and I can't figure why they thought they would; didn't Brita bother to do some product testing?  Couldn't the adapter be metal at least?Well the latest version of the Brita system (our third) still has the same mounting has stayed on better than its predecessors but still sufferes the same problem.  The adapter stays on the tap just fine but it doesn't hold up the Brita unit dependably at all.BOTTOM LINE: PUR has the brains to know that once the adapter is on the tap how the unit attaches to it could be absolutely any way that's best.  So the PUR system doesn't screw on; it just clicks into place and it works.  It does not go crashing into the sink full of dishes; it does not spray water all over the place; you can manhandle it and it stays put.  And for this reason alone the PUR filter is the clear winner.,Y,N,,,
B0009CEKY6,Does it come with a filter?,"This is my second Pur 3-Stage Faucet Mount Chrome Water Purifier. After a time on each of the units I bought the threads on the PLASTIC adapter collar that attaches the filter unit to the faucet will fail. Once that happens the first time you will not be able to securely attach the filter back onto the faucet.Why? Because if you put a little pressure downward on the heavy water-filled filter unit the light duty plastic threads on the adapter collar have been stripped after the first fail and will never again be capable of a secure tight attachment afterwards. You will then either have to replace the unit or try to order a new part requiring several day  waiting time until the new part arrives and in the meantime you go without filtered water. Did a child design this thing?WHY DOES pur INSIST ON USING A PLASTIC ATTACHMENT COLLAR? USE METAL AS WAS USED IN THE ORIGINAL MODELS. I CANNOT FATHOM WHY A LARGE CORPORATION LIKE KAZ INC. WOULD USE A CHEAP EASILY STRIPPED PLASTIC COLLAR. Why would they risk their reputation like this? Is a metal collar THAT expensive?The entire unit keeps falling into the sink with the slightest pressure after you once knock the filter into the sink the first time stripping the plastic threads and it is a big bother to reattach all the time. Would the price then be higher than the Britta competition by using metal threaded collars? I am angry and disgusted. I want a real water filter a piece of adult hardware designed for adults not a plastic toy.UPDATE: I called PUR after writing this. A Customer Service employee agreed with my complaint and consented to send a replacement collar in plastic but with METAL threads and it did indeed arrive a few days later and is working well so far. She added that the firm is ""in the process"" of redesigning the adapter collar in Plastic but with Metal threads and that will come with all future filter models. I certainly hope that is true. If it is true then the problem will be solved. But prior to buying make sure your collar comes with metal threads!!! Question: Why was this not done in the first place? For replacement parts call 1-800-PUR-LINE or email: customerrelations@kaz.com.I hope this was helpful to you.

B0009CEKY6,Does it come with a filter?,HiI bought this despite the bad reviews to replace my old unit since I still have some filters left. Also the old unit worked okay for a longer time but needed to be replaced.During the installation the little chrome plastic sleeve under the mounting fell off like it was never really attached.The filter can`t handle the water pressure at my place the water comes out above and underneath the faucet mounting ring and mixes with filtered water which is no good.I used some tape to get a better seal and now the water which still comes out underneath the ring at least does not mix with filtered water.The unit is defiantly going into the trash after I used the rest of my filters of.I am much happier with the Culligan unit when it comes to craftsmanship but I can`t say how long the filter is going to last since I just got it.,Y,N,,,
B0009CEKY6,Does it come with a filter?,These filters work great until they break. They newly designed system that Bruce the rep from the manufacturer keeps touting is a great IDEA but very poorly DESIGNED. The idea is that you remove the screw on screen from the end of your faucet and then screw on the small black collar that the filter then attaches to by simply pushing it onto the end of the collar. The problem is that the collar only has maybe three complete turns of thread inside it so it never really gets a firm hold on the faucet. Eventually the collar will loosen and fall off the threaded end of your faucet and the whole filter assembly will fall into the sink. The threads on the soft plastic collar will ultimately be damaged and you will have to purchase another filter assembly. This is so obvious a problem that I can't believe that PUR doesn't include at least one extra collar with the filter housing. They need to make the female threaded end of the collar at least 50% deeper so that the collar can at least have a chance of staying on the faucet more than a few months.  Another fix for this flaw if Bruce would like to consider it would be to replace the offending soft plastic collar with one made from more durable material such as high density nylon (like what is used for bushings in the automotive industry) or brass or stainless steel.Even though I like the water these filters produce I wouldn't buy another one if I hadn't recently purchased two six packs of cartridges. I'm stuck using this poorly designed device until I use up my cartridges. I'm thinking that perhaps a small amount of Teflon tape might help secure the collar or maybe even a small amount of gasket adhesive.Perhaps even Bruce will offer some guidance beyond emailing or calling his help line.********** UPDATE**********I did call and order the free upgraded ring. The ring does indeed improve the reliability of the filter assembly. I'm keeping my rating at the original two stars however because I think PUR should address this issue by making a design change to the OEM assembly or include the metal rings that I had to call the company and wait for a couple weeks to get in the mail.Quite frankly I'm getting rid of the faucet mounted filters. I just had Culligan come out today and install a whole house filter system that provides the same quality water the faucet mounted PUR filter does except  now I get the same great water from every faucet in my house for $35 a month. Quite a bargain when you compare what you get for what you pay.,Y,N,,,
B0009CEKY6,Does it come with a filter?,I have used both Brita and PUR filters and find PUR to produce superior results.  This improved mount is easier to install than previous models.  It looks pretty nice and does the job.  Over time these filters to experience some buildup from hard water and often wind of cracking after about a year.While this product is good to have in the home I prefer the PUR pitcher. While it is also made of plastic seems to last longer without the buildup and cracks.,Y,N,,,
B0009CEKY6,Does it come with a filter?,We have the PUR 1800 dispenser in our fridge as well as a few Brita pitchers.This faucet-attached filter installed very easily is convenient to use and is great for drawing filtered water that does not need to be cold...such as for coffee tea filling ice trays...or just drinking (some people prefer their drinking water at room temp here).Recommended.,Y,N,,,

B0001ZI560,does dc0090 18.v same as dc9096 18.v,I own a lot of 18V DeWalt batteries(NICd) and tools (about 7 drills 3 or 4 reciprocating saws rotary laser level 3 cordless nail guns etc.). Most of them are dead. Some of them are less than 2 years. All of DeWalt 18V batteries discharge very quickly by themselves without using (less than a week after fully charged). I understand none of rechargeable batteries last forever and there is a life span. But comparing to other brands DeWalt batteries are the most expensive and last less. Last year I bought a 18v combo set (drill circular saw & flash light w/2 batteries) of Porter Cable at Lowes. I think it was less than $100.00. It has been a year. I don't take this one to the job site because all of my cordless tools are DeWalt. It has been in the garage for more than a year. I have not recharged battery yet after fully charged on the date of purchase. I have been using it occasionally but it is still very powerful almost same as the fully charged on the first day. It is very hard for me to change other brands of cordless because I already have  too many 18v DeWalt. I agree with most of negative reviews. Before I place this review I have thought a lot whether I am wrong or I expect too much. However DeWalt batteries are too expensive and don't last long comparing to other brands. I use these tools almost every day as a professional carpenter. Early this year I bought a combo set of Lithium 18V DeWalt drill & impact. It is still working good same as new one. I wish to buy another DeWalt 18v lithium battery only but too expensive.

B001LJKLT4,Can rechargeable batteries be used?,Okay so I thought that I totally wasted my money when I opened the battery compartment and two metal contacts fell out! After a little reconstructive work with the needle nose pliers I carefully wedged the rechargeable batteries into place and shut the lid. When I flipped it over the translucent motion sensor lense fell out! I turned on the power switch and the light came on. Good brightness and light pattern. I mounted it with a screw to the ceiling of my closet and it's been working great for 4 weeks. Comes on every time shuts off every time. Very nice. I'd buy it again.,Y,Y,,,
B001LJKLT4,Can rechargeable batteries be used?,Excellent product.  I have a similar light that I bought more than two and half years ago and it works  perfectly.  I even used old batteries that would not work on other equipment.  The old batteries work perfectly and I only replaced  them three times in the past two and half years.,Y,N,,,
B001LJKLT4,Can rechargeable batteries be used?,I have purchased 6 of these over the years and they are all in use throughout my house. They are great in closets in long dark hallways on stairways etc. I do not use much lighting in my house so these serve the purpose very well. Rechargeable alkaline batteries last about a month in hallways and about two months in closets. The light is very bright and they have worked without problems for several years.,Y,Y,,,

B001LJKLT4,Can rechargeable batteries be used?,Works as described has a pretty ggod range for sensing movement. I thought the light was bright enough to illuminate 10+ sqft of area.

B001LJKLT4,Can rechargeable batteries be used?,First of all I'd like to say how pleasurable it is to shop online here at here at Amazon.com. The whole buying and shipping process is always a breeze and I hardly shop anywhere else online now.I bought three of these LCD motion sensor lights to be used as auxiliary under cabinet kitchen lights. For this function they perform well. The light isn't as bright as my wife or I would find ideal but they do the job.To mount the lights horizontally facing down was a challenge. What I settled on was to screw a small steel plate to the underside of the cabinets then use magnets to hold the lights. This has worked well as they hold the lights firmly yet allow easy removal for replacing/recharging the batteries ... the magnets are attracted to the metal in the batteries. I used hobby magnets part# 98406 from Harbor Freight ... one per light.For batteries I am using Sanyo Eneloop AA NiMH rechargeable batteries and these are working very well. I've been using them for this purpose for about a month now and still haven't had to recharge them so I'd say they last a good while between charges.I also hoped to use these lights in a bedroom closet but found them inadequate for this ... I guess I'm going to have to run wired lights in there.Sanyo Eneloop 8 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries,Y,Y,,,

B0001EFSTI,Is the item airport friendly?,I love this little key. I can't count the number of times I've needed a screwdriver small knife or bottle opener (don't judge me I love beer!) and had to resort to other methods - like using a regular key to try to cut something open or the tip as a screwdriver. Yeuch. Doesn't work well and doesn't do anything for my sanity.Found the utilikey and I love having it on my keychain. The tools aren't the greatest version of each but they get the job done and most importantly they're always right there with me. I used to carry a Swiss army knife on my keychain but it was too big and couldn't go through airport security. This performs almost as well and takes up much less space.,Y,Y,,,
B0001EFSTI,Is the item airport friendly?,This is the second I bought.  I've had the first for 4+ years and use it constantly.  When I get the opportunity to backpack around Europe it is a huge lifesaver.  Without exaggeration it's passed through airport security on my key chain at lease 50 times and has never had a second glance.  It's one of my top five most valuable items when bumming around the globe.  I've been through Europe Asia Central America etc.  It's amazing how valuable a small knife and a bottle opener can be when hanging out it hostels.,Y,Y,,,
B0001EFSTI,Is the item airport friendly?,This is a handy tool if you can't our are uncomfortable having a knife or multi tool.  However this is not the item you want to rely on to get you through a tough spot.  More of a hey i don't have to look for this other tool.  I don't expect it will last more than a few uses and would not purchase it again.,Y,N,,,
B0001EFSTI,Is the item airport friendly?,Simple functional a must have item for every keyring you have. Car truck boat motorcycle ATV riding mower tractor anything that takes a key needs this on the ring.,Y,N,,,
B0001EFSTI,Is the item airport friendly?,What I like about this is it looks just like a key and will pass through airport security (I store my keys in my laptop while travelling). I had to surrender a small Swiss army knife a few years ago and really missed having it. If you need a knife bottle opener or Phillips screw driver this will do the job. The slotted screw driver tip hasn't been very useful for me and because the knife is angled on one side it doesn't cut straight. But in a pinch it will do the job and is better than nothing.,Y,N,,,
B0001EFSTI,Is the item airport friendly?,No it is not a leatherman.  It's a small knife and screwdriver - which is very useful for everyday situations.While traveling I need something lightweight that I can carry with me and use.  I use to carry a small swiss army pen knife but kept losing it in airport security.The only way they could improve it is to somehow make it include scissors.,Y,N,,,
B0001EFSTI,Is the item airport friendly?,I'm not a tool guy but this thing is terrific.  It looks like a car key fits on a key chain and can go through airport security without a hassle. It doesn't look like much but I carry it with me everywhere.  I have used the screwdriver and knife countless time.  The best $6-$7 I've spent in a long time.,Y,Y,,,
B0039PV1QK,Can a 3 year old kid turn on and off?,Excellent flashlight strong & bright. I don't yet know how long the batteries last but it's not all that important to me anyway.,Y,N,,,

B0039PV1QK,Can a 3 year old kid turn on and off?,I had several flashlights none of them worked good  so I ordered two of these they work great good light.,Y,N,,,
B0039PV1QK,Can a 3 year old kid turn on and off?,Over the past couple years I've purchased several of these flashlights for my own use (one in each car one in the kitchen one in the garage one in the media room to help with finding the appropriate remote control etc.) and perhaps five more as gifts.  They are great gifts for those of all ages but I've particular found that children enjoy them.  I gave another to an eleven year old this Christmas as a gift.Somehow the flashlight is just the right size.  It's easy to grip and hold.  The yellow color makes it very easy to find.  The battery life is excellent; years of normal use in my experience but of course that would vary with individual use patterns.  The flashlight can be stood on end or laid flat.  When laid flat it stays where placed and doesn't roll around which is great.I would and have purchase(d) this product again.,Y,Y,,,
B0039PV1QK,Can a 3 year old kid turn on and off?,Great price great name great led flashlight!  It even comes with BATTERIES!It has 4 BRIGHT led bulbs... it's fairly compact at about 6 inches in length.  It's not heavy because it uses AA batteries.  It is REALLY bright.I bought these and got rid of my old single bulb reflector flashlights.  This is more modern lasts longer fits nicely in your hand (with rubber grips around it)... and even has a carabineer clip on the end to hang it off something!,Y,N,,,
B0039PV1QK,Can a 3 year old kid turn on and off?,This flashlight doesn't compete with a $30+ Fenix or other similar &#34;tactical&#34; LED flashlights but for the price it's a good value. The best part unlike many similarly priced LED models it has a simple ON/OFF switch. You don't have to press the button 4+ times to cycle through bright/normal/dim/blink/etc when you just want to turn it on or off. The beam is a good mix of spot and wide. It's also harder to misplace than the little black slender flashlights. If you're not looking for small size maximum lumens or to drive over it with your car you can buy three or more of these for the price of one higher end flashlight. And it's a much better option than the similarly priced Chinese no-name flashlights that fail after only a few uses.,Y,N,,,
B0039PV1QK,Can a 3 year old kid turn on and off?,This is a great flashlight. It gives off a lot of light is really durable and is a great size. I will definitely be buying more.,Y,N,,,
B0039PV1QK,Can a 3 year old kid turn on and off?,Good flash light at rock bottom pricing. Lights up large areas great.Be aware that this is not a good flashlight for people with limited mobility.It takes some effort to replace the batteries in the internal cartridge and obviously it would be even more difficult to doin the dark.  The button to turn off/on is made of soft rubber and my old aunt found it nearly impossible to operate.,Y,N,,,
B0039PV1QK,Can a 3 year old kid turn on and off?,My 2 year old loves playing with this light and it's held up great. The light output is more than enough for normal uses inside a house perhaps outside it would be less ideal at longer ranges due to the wide beam pattern. Overall a great value at a little over eight dollars.,Y,Y,,,
B0039PV1QK,Can a 3 year old kid turn on and off?,I use it all the time and a year later the batteries are still good. The light is very bright and focused. And the color makes it easy to locate even in its usual place lol.,Y,N,,,

B0039PV1QK,Has anyone else had trouble with the flashlight not always turning on? Not sure what's wrong with it because I just got it.,At this price how (WHY) would anyone complain ? Any less and it would be free. OK it could be some may have received a defective one if it takes on water but I think you need to be sure you tighten the head very well after installing batteries. I submerged mine in water today for over an hour while it was on and not a drop of water got inside. Also the light patern has a very nice beam and yes some rings off to the side of the spill (FLOOD) area. Folks this flashlight has a GREAT 32 LUMENS OF light output a runtime of up to 20 hour's it is WATERPROOF and FLOATS and for about $8.00 what am I missing here? Awesome light in my opinion and I also just picked up the DORCY CYBER LIGHT today model # 41-4750 180 lumens and very highly rated as well. It is only 8:00 pm here in New York right now and I can't wait for it to get dark to put the CYBER LIGHT to the test tonight.,N,N,,,
B0039PV1QK,Has anyone else had trouble with the flashlight not always turning on? Not sure what's wrong with it because I just got it.,Not much more can be said that other reviewers have already stated but this light impressed me.For 32 lumens I didn't have high expectations on the brightness but turning it on I was impressed because I wasn't expecting 32 lumens to be that bright. Don't get me wrong it's not going to light up an entire alley way it was just brighter than I anticipated.It's bulkier bright yellow and rubberized handle and top to help absorb any shocks from a fall or knock over.Too many flashlights are all black so the high visibility yellow is a plus to me standard AA batteries are sold everywhere a plus for anyone.The best thing about this light is the price tag at just 7 dollars this is an impressive light. You can get lights far cheaper with batteries at Walmart I call those cheap outdated flashlights 'disposable flashlights' once the battery is drained throw the whole thing away and buy another one since the batteries to replace cost more than the flashlight itself that comes with batteries. This Dorcy isn't a disposable I like the light and body and brightness.$7 just 7 dollars buy it if you're considering this light. Obviously this isn't the best brightest flashlight out there but at this price its 5 stars.,N,N,,,
B0039PV1QK,Has anyone else had trouble with the flashlight not always turning on? Not sure what's wrong with it because I just got it.,I got the flashlight unfortunately it did not work. It wasn't worth my while to send it back because the price was inexpensive. Disappointed.,N,Y,,,
B0039PV1QK,Has anyone else had trouble with the flashlight not always turning on? Not sure what's wrong with it because I just got it.,Got two of these and they put out a lot of light and last a long time on the batteries.  Used them at work and at home this year with the power outages during some winter storms.  Got to say Duke Power got me back on with power quickly but these lights got used at work and at home.  I will be getting more of these.,N,N,,,
B0039PV1QK,Has anyone else had trouble with the flashlight not always turning on?

B0039PV1QK,Has anyone else had trouble with the flashlight not always turning on? Not sure what's wrong with it because I just got it.,What's not to like?  Uses AA batteries.  Now every gadget I have uses AA batteries.  Sits in a drawer by the back door.  Is easy to find  in the drawer and fits the hand well.  Can slip into the back pocket easily.  Very bright and lights up a wide area.  Does not focus down to a narrow beam if that's what you need.  Says its waterproof - looks like it.,N,N,,,
B0039PV1QK,Has anyone else had trouble with the flashlight not always turning on? Not sure what's wrong with it because I just got it.,And dont' get me wrong I know you can't expect much from a $7-$8 flashlight I'm always the first to admit this.  I was a little disappointed with the build/construction of the flashlight and the non-uniform output.  Where this flashlight DOES excel is that it's cheap enough to throw around the car drawer or anywhere else for a quick cheap flashlight need and not have to worry about losing.  Don't expect wonders!,N,N,,,

B000O8OTNC,Can i sharpen a blade with a 20 degree angle with this sharpener?,Does a good job of resharpening when in the woods or away from home. It doesn't replace water stones or diamond plates but it will keep your knife cutting.,Y,N,,,
B000O8OTNC,Can i sharpen a blade with a 20 degree angle with this sharpener?,compact and light will fit easly in my hiking pack and be there if/when I need it.  All my knifes are sharp now so I'll have to wait to see how it performs.,Y,N,,,
B000O8OTNC,Can i sharpen a blade with a 20 degree angle with this sharpener?,This is a good little sharpener. I've already given a couple away to friends when they see them so I am always replacing one as I am now. A few thoughts.... I like this PP1 for my smaller working knives not my more expensive big knives. First of all any blade over 7 inches kind be awkward to sharpen.The 45 degree angle is somewhat limiting so be cautious of what type of blade grind you use in this sharpener. I think extended use with a convex asymmetrical or hollow grind will eventually turn them into 45 degree flat grinds. Flat ground blades are probably the best type to use the PP1 on in my opinion.The flip out diamond rod has been a blessing for the few blades I have with partial serrations. The only drawback is that it removes a lot of metal. Speaking of metal... I have a couple titanium bonded blades which are next to impossible to sharpen on the PP1.Overall I think the PP1 is a great companion for a favorite everyday carry (EDC) knife or only those select few which would be good with this sharpener. For my larger knives and finer knives I use a series of stones depending on the results I wish to achieve. Thanks for reading.SPO,Y,Y,,,
B000O8OTNC,Can i sharpen a blade with a 20 degree angle with this sharpener?,Like the title says. Available everywhere with a great price on Amazon. Simple (foolproof) to use. Sharpens at one set fixed angle (20 degrees?) non adjustable so it's not intended for specialized sharpening of high end knives or complex type edges (hollow ground convex ground etc). More elaborate sharpening 'systems' are available for those. Understand the limitations and this one is very handy.,Y,Y,,,
B000O8OTNC,Can i sharpen a blade with a 20 degree angle with this sharpener?,I carry a Benchmade pocket knife wherever I go and it is important to always keep it sharp.This is a unit that is small and can be carried in a backpack briefcase or your pocket.Works very well and sharpens quickly.Note:  It doesn't take a lot of pressure to maintain an edge.  Just hold you knife straight and use slight downward pressure while dragging the knife backwards.  Keep the handle at a 45 degree angle.,Y,N,,,
B000O8OTNC,Can i sharpen a blade with a 20 degree angle with this sharpener?,Pros: cost and its super effective.Cons: it's a bit hard to use the serrated sharpener. The ceramic and carbide straight edge sharpeners work amazing while rotating the keychain sized device and pulling away at a 15 degree angle is a bit hard. It does work though.All-in-all I would recommend this to anyone needing a simple sharpener.,Y,N,,,
B000O8OTNC,Can i sharpen a blade with a 20 degree angle with this sharpener?,Bought this to use in the field so I didn't have to lug around a stone.  I tried it out on my high carbon camp knife and it really dulled it down just using the ceramic. Not a pleasant surprise since I was deep in the BWCA and just south of the canadian border. Had to borrow my friends stone to get the edge back.I believe the angle of the sharpeners to be around 23-25 degrees(I didn't measure just eyeballed it) and I keep my camp knife at 20 degrees.  So the sharpener was actually changing the angle of the grind and basically dulling my knife.  23-25 degrees may work fine for some people but I keep field knives at 20 and fillet knives at 15 degrees. I'm a little confused by all the positive reviews but I would tell people to stay away from this sharpener.,Y,Y,,,
B000O8OTNC,Can i sharpen a blade with a 20 degree angle with this sharpener?,So many knife factories grind their bevels at the wrong angle. Something like 45-50 degrees. The result is that a proper sharpening angle of 40 degrees will not even TOUCH the cutting edge until after several hours' worth of work. Most folks will just wonder why their knives aren't getting sharp and assume either the product is a piece of junk or they're doing something wrong.This is where this simple little guy comes in: Stage 1 is a couple of carbide blocks. Pull the badly ground knife through these a few times and it literally slices off little strips of steel from the blade and what is left is at the correct 30 degree angle. (though it is coarse) Then polish it up with the coarse ceramic stones. At this point you will be left with a reasonably durable and very sharp edge.If you want to finish it properly take the knife over to your Spyderco Sharpmaker and then go through the steps to hone the 40 degree edge that is at the tip of the 30 degree one you just made.Everything else has no doubt been pointed out by the other 400+ reviewers so I will leave it at that. Even to someone who really knows his stuff; knows the theory and method to execute a proper double bevel edge this little guy is a real time-saver.The fold out rod is not  that great. The diamond dust seems to fall right off. Don't buy it for that feature.,Y,N,,,
B000O8OTNC,Can i sharpen a blade with a 20 degree angle with this sharpener?,This little sharpener is very easy to use with better than average results.  I have not achieved a shaving quality edge from this device but it gets close.I have sharpened my Bowie Kukri fillet and folder with this gadget and have been very happy with the results.  As with most sharpeners the results are largely based on the accurate use and angle.Unless you are reprofiling an edge don't use too much pressure.  Be certain that your blade is bilaterally at a 90 degree angle to the sharpener.  When using the diamond rod on serrations the angle of your stroke can perfect or destroy the knife serrations.If used correctly this is the lightest easiest and quickest blade sharpener out there.  5-star product without a doubt.,Y,N,,,

B00009LI4K,Will this fit a woman with small head?,Amazing 30 db noise reduction.  Comfortable makes .22s sound like nothing and 9mm quite quiet.  Vry highly recommended.  They feel solid.,Y,N,,,
B00009LI4K,Will this fit a woman with small head?,I bought these for my husband but I use them sometimes when I mow the lawn.  They are quite comfortable and good for blocking motor noise.,Y,N,,,
B00009LI4K,Will this fit a woman with small head?,Keeps me from going deaf while mowing the lawn.,Y,N,,,
B00009LI4K,Will this fit a woman with small head?,I shopped around a lot I wasn't able to find anything better than this. This could serve many purposes for shooting working around heavy machinery etc. Personally I use them because I have a noise sensitivity which makes it hard for me to do certain tasks like vacuuming the house or focus on doing something when loud noises are present. These are a good coping mechanism for that but if you're buying them for this purpose it's important to NOT wear them all the time only when you need to. Wearing them constantly will make the problem worse.When I first put them on it seemed like they did not fit. There are actually expansion bars in the headband the wires leading from the headband to the earmuffs can extend out from the headband. It takes a little force to get them to do so and then they will fit(very snugly.) I wear glasses and wearing these over them isn't immediately uncomfortable.,Y,N,,,
B00009LI4K,Will this fit a woman with small head?,Put these on and turn on your shop vac and you will be amazed how much noise reduction these earmuffs provides.  In addition the ear pieces are very soft and extremely comfortable.  Wear them to be near any machinery or mowing your lawn and your ears will thank you.,Y,N,,,
B00009LI4K,Will this fit a woman with small head?,I can wear these and so can my two kids ages 8 and 10.  However the head set is too small to comfortably fit my husband's head.  There doesn't seem to be a way to adjust them.  If they don't fit right out of the box then you might can't use them.I took them with me to go shotgun shooting way out in the boonies and they really kept the sound out of my ears.  I am female and have an average head size and they were very comfortable for me to wear.  Also I use these to read while the rest of the family watches T.V. in the same room.  I like to be with them but don't necessarily like to watch the same things on T.V.  Besides I like to read and these allow me to read and not be distracted by sounds coming from the T.V. set.They seem to be well constructed and I expect them to last for several years.  They really do a great job of blocking out sound.  I have to lift one side off my ear so I can hear when somebody wants to talk to me.,Y,Y,,,
B00009LI4K,Will this fit a woman with small head?,I bought these to wear to the gun range.  Very effective there and worked great when I was using a jackhammer in my backyard as well.  The only thing negative I can say is that they are very bulky... others @ the gun range were using small ear buds...,Y,N,,,

B000NQ4PBG,"Does this include a 13/16"" socket?",I bought this set to supplement a socket set that I purchased a few days before buy these.  Sometimes those &#34;so-called&#34; ALL inclusive sets don't have the essentials like step-down and step-up adapters.  It's good to know that I can get the benefits of impact strength for my socket set although I plan to use these primarily as a regular socket adapters.,N,N,,,
B000NQ4PBG,"Does this include a 13/16"" socket?",This package does provide every needed combination of adapters for your tool box.  As a plus it looks pretty good.  The problem I found at least on the set I got is the springs which push on the ball bearing provide way too much pressure.  This makes removal difficult had to resort to a screw driver to get my sockets released from these tools.  Metal tolerances seem ok fits most of my stuff.,N,N,,,
B000NQ4PBG,"Does this include a 13/16"" socket?",Does exactly what they are supposed to do at a fraction of the price of a &#34;nicer set&#34;.Finish is nice and matte and quality components. I have torqued several bolts very heavily and felt no failure or strain in the part.,N,N,,,

B00004TUCV,has anyone attempted a smartphone glass replacement with this gun?,I bought this heat gun specifically to repair my YLOD PS3. It appears to be the most affordable one on Amazon and it does a great job. I was skeptical about the whole heat gun trick but it actually worked. There's not much to the heat gun; it has a HIGH and LOW setting. It also stands perfectly on it's butt so you don't have to worry about it touching things while it cools. I'm very satisfied with this product.,Y,N,,,
B00004TUCV,has anyone attempted a smartphone glass replacement with this gun?,Silly I know but sometimes things just need to dry.  This works well with my electronics products but has proven valuable for drying things like paint and glue.  Careful it gets very hot.,Y,N,,,

B00004TUCV,has anyone attempted a smartphone glass replacement with this gun?,I'm using this to apply heat shrink tubing. It works great on high - you just have to keep it moving.  Has a flat back so you can set it down on the bench when not using it (it also has a hook).  Seems well-built and sturdy. No complaints.,Y,N,,,
B00004TUCV,has anyone attempted a smartphone glass replacement with this gun?,I use this heat gun in my PC repair shop mostly to laptop parts attached with double-sided tape or glue.

B00004TUCV,has anyone attempted a smartphone glass replacement with this gun?,Pros:- Fires hot air- Dual mode so you can fire REALLY hot air- Low setting is adequate to gradually heat a delicate surface like say a smartphone- Small lightweight easy to handleCons:- Doesn't make toas..... WAIT A MINUTE. I'll have to get back to you.,Y,Y,,,
B00004TUCV,has anyone attempted a smartphone glass replacement with this gun?,I bought this when it was for sale on a lightning deal $9.99. I use this gun solely for heat shrink. I do a lot of soldering and wanted a good quality heat gun. This Wagner gun works fabulously. I have not had any issues with this gun at all. It has a low and a high setting. I use the low for my heat shrink and occasionally the high if I have a lot of heat shrink and I am in a hurry.Here is the heat shrink tubing that I use: [...]I definitely recommend this gun to anyone looking for a gun for heat shrinking. I will most likely purchase a second one just so I can keep one in my truck as well as in my shop.,Y,N,,,
B00BB2MMNE,Can more than one iPhone control a single wemo switch?,I was unable to use the product. Apparently the app needed to use the device is only for Android 4.0 and up. My Droid X is unable to be used. Also showed my Nexus 7 incompatible even though it has the latest Android version.,Y,N,,,
B00BB2MMNE,Can more than one iPhone control a single wemo switch?,Simple to install and program love having our front porch light come on each evening at sunset (and off at 10pm) and then again each morning at 6am before we depart for our morning walk (and off at sunrise).,Y,N,,,
B00BB2MMNE,Can more than one iPhone control a single wemo switch?,I use this to start an engine block heater on my tractor in the winter.  I have been pleased with its performance and it works just as intended.,Y,N,,,
B00BB2MMNE,Can more than one iPhone control a single wemo switch?,I have a single light switch for my bedroom recessed lights (main lighting for the room) which is far from my bed and not even within line of sight so this solution works great for me. I had no problems installing it and getting it to work with the app. Since I keep my iPhone 5 near my bed at night this switch allows me to turn off the lights easily.Tip: Since you can control this switch even when away from home you have to be careful not to leave the lights on after demonstrating it to friends.Tip 2: Because the switch works over wifi make sure your phone itself is connected to your home wifi for best performance. I noticed that if I have the wifi off and my phone is using the 4G cellular data connection there is a significant delay in response and status updates - a few seconds vs. instantly. Before I figured this out I thought the switch was failing.Tip 3: If you reboot your wifi or your internet connection goes down the switch may have trouble reconnecting when the network is back up. I'm not sure how long it tries to reconnect but it was easy enough to reset it manually. I've only had to do this once since installing it about 2 months ago.,Y,Y,,,
B00BB2MMNE,Can more than one iPhone control a single wemo switch?,Over the years trying to find a good solution to get the porch light to turn on and off on it's own has been a struggle. Be it with sensors or solar lights nothing has really been accurate. Finally some modern stepped in! Installation is a little more complex than I had hoped it's more than just screwing off of the old plate and putting this one on you have to mess with the wires some as outlined in the installation. As a result this is probably meant more for home owners than renters. You can program on your phone what specific times you want the lights to come on/off or you can even enter in where you live and the app will automatically have the lights turn on and off at dusk and dawn for your location (pretty cool). Even though the switch has been programmed it still has a manual use (like a normal switch) that you can continue to use as you want. Now I'm pretty interested in getting some of the plugs I have a lot of ideas for those too.,Y,N,,,
B00BB2MMNE,Can more than one iPhone control a single wemo switch?,I LOVE Belkin products as much as Apple fans love iPhones. The design and ease-of-use are unparalleled and they somehow manage to take something complex like home automation and make it dead simple.I can even control the electricity for my lights when I'm away from the house!I already had several WeMo wall switches for my living room lamps and I was VERY excited to receive the WeMo Light Switch! I've been looking for a good solution for keeping my porch lights on at night and all the solutions I used or looked at before (daylight sensors etc.) were either incompatible with LED bulbs or caused annoying flicker/strobing at dusk.The WeMo light switch fixed all that! Now I have my porch lights programmed to come on at sunset and stay on till sunrise every day (and the WeMo system is smart enough to know that sunrise/sunset times vary throughout the year!) and it's been working perfectly preventing a lot of late night fumbling with keys in the dark.The big drawback to be aware of is that the switch itself is rather bulky enough that it barely fit into our box. In fact It crushed our wires back so much that it pulled them out of place and I think I electrocuted myself about 5 times trying to adjust everything to make it work (since I got sick of going back and forth to our outdoor circuit breaker).It also only supports single pole switches meaning it can only handle on/off where there's one switch controlling the lights (instead of say two switches at the end of a hallway or room each controlling the same lights).I also wish that they had an iPad-specific app instead of the iPhone app you can simply magnify but I love my WeMo system better than just about anything!,Y,Y,,,
B00BB2MMNE,Can more than one iPhone control a single wemo switch?,This switch works exactly as advertised using iPhones/iPads on a Linksys home network.  It is responsive in manual mode and responds immediately to inputs from my iPhone or iPad.  It is yet to be seen what happens if we have a power failure.  Hopefully the switch will automatically reset.  This switch is meant to replace a single-switched outlet only.  It cannot be used where multiple wall switches control one light.Installation is straightforward and all screws and electrical wiring caps are provided.  You must cut power to the switch you are replacing via the circuit breaker box.  Be aware the unit itself is much larger than a simple single-switch and will require more space fitting into existing wall boxes.  This required some creative storing of existing wiring behind it in our metal wall box.  Connecting to our home WiFi network was simple and fast following the simple instructions provided in the iPhone app.We can now turn our interior hall light on from the outside with our iPhone we can program this light just as we would a timer controlled light when away and we can operate the switch manually like a normal light switch.  The little green LED on the switch helps us find it in the dark.I appreciate a product that installs simply works exactly as advertised causes no surprises and provides an incremental improvement over what it replaces.  The WEMO does all this...highly recommended.,Y,N,,,
B00BB2MMNE,Can more than one iPhone control a single wemo switch?,**Edit**I ended up installing this to a switched outlet for my porch. I was able to program it and it works nicely though the software was a little awkward. I'd give more specifics about how it was awkward to set up but since it got cold outside (the switch is in a non heated area) I can not get the software to connect to the switch. Well it used to connect to the switch which allowed me to turn it off from the software. As December moved along into even colder weather I can no longer connect to the switch. Thankfully however it continues to turn on and off with the schedule I originally set. Unfortunately I can not adjust that schedule since I can't connect to the switch at all. Maybe it will work again in the spring.I do like the product when it's fully functional though the software could have been a little better.**Original Review**The switch was Dead On Arrival. I tried this thing in place of two different light switches in my house and it didn't work. In my tests I took out the light switch put this one in place of it and nothing. I put the old standard style light switches back in and they worked fine. Maybe this is a little complex for something a simple as a light switch. The idea seems cool though.I'd like to point out that this only works with single switched lights. I mostly have multi switch lights in my house so I didn't have a lot of useful options for this switch once I started looking for the best place to use it. I did use the proper single switch lights in my tests.,Y,N,,,
B00BB2MMNE,Can more than one iPhone control a single wemo switch?,It's network range isn't very good - places where my phone or laptop get single te WeMo doesn't.I am using it in a location where it works..... but where I WANTED to put it doesn't -,Y,N,,,
B00BB2MMNE,Can more than one iPhone control a single wemo switch?,Through firmware updates and the addition of Android support I have to say that the WeMo system has come along since it's introduction. I was in the initial release of theBelkin WeMo Home Automation Switch for Apple iPhone iPad and iPod touchand while it was a bit clunky and unreliable the system has shown drastic improvements. Creating a schedule is far more intuitive than thePhilips 431643 Hue Personal Wireless Lighting Starter Pack Frustration Freewhich I also own.The scheduling system is the same on the switch as all of your WeMo compatible products show up in a list on the app for you to select.The product itself is a bit larger than a typical electrical switch. This may pose a problem for those with older houses. I've had to enlarge some of the boxes in my house to make other switches work but this one was okay.For me the issue was actually finding a single pole switched item to attach this to. I have many switches in the house which have dimmers on them and I want to retain that dimmer function and they're all double pole. Others have the small rocker switches controlling three items in one junction box. A single switched (no separate light control) on a ceiling fan ended up being the victim. Not the greatest choice if you're after the lighting aspect for security when you're out of town but it's okay if you remember to turn the light portion on manually for your ceiling fan.Overall it's a great product and for the price I wouldn't hesitate to buy another if I had more compatible options in the house.,Y,N,,,

B005E48K6I,my light does not turn on. only sometimes if i hold the switch half way down. is the switch defective?,I ordered because it was cheap the small size using only one 18650 battery and the good reviews.I received the item the packaging was very good.  The built of the product is very good sturdy nice size and bright too (but it is definitely not 1000 lumens).The bad:The reflector the light pattern is not uniform not center nor diffused it is like the old mag lights your can see the light rings with a dark spot this is off center.The switch it cycles not remembering the last set up.Conclusion: The two bad marks bring a very nice flashlight all the way down to 2 stars.  I cannot give it lower only because it is cheap and I believe in &#34;what you get is what you paid for&#34; and the fact that is it is pretty bright.Recommendation:Depends what you want for the price it is a very nice light that is bright and functional.  Beyond that if you expect qualities like a Fenix the you will be disappointed.I have a collection of flashlights and not looking for a cheap product that is below the quality so I'll look into the Fenix PD35.,Y,N,,,
B005E48K6I,my light does not turn on. only sometimes if i hold the switch half way down. is the switch defective?,This is the second one of these units that I have had that has a finicky switch.  Causes flickering and inconsistent behavior.  The switch is just to sensitive or something and will change settings during use and generally just performs poorly.  My two units are not the only ones that I have saw with this issue.  I wish it had one setting for on/off and that's it.  Bright as can be thought.,Y,Y,,,

Easy to turn the light off in the process or to change the mode while turning it off. But the light feels solid (metal). It does get hot if left running for a while in the highest setting.

B005E48K6I,my light does not turn on. only sometimes if i hold the switch half way down. is the switch defective?,These new gen flashlights are finally going to make LEDs the way we all use flashlights and the 18650 or similar LiIon batteries are worth the switch since 1.2-1.5 volt batteries require those awful three-cell holders in recent LED devices.The Ultrafire has a nice feel in the hand and is plenty bright to see the beam in a bright room in daylight.  The switch between Hi and Low and strobe is not easy;  about one in three times I turn it on to strobe and everyone is startled.  Someone else pointed out that a soft touch on the switch changes modes but this is too subtle for me.My ideal lamp would have a better selector switch and maybe an internal charger and a way to become a table light by twisting the lens out.  I've seen these features on other lights but not in the same one or with the LiIon battery.  I suspect the perfect option is just around the corner but the Ultrafire 502 will be great until perfect comes along.,Y,Y,,,

It's nice and bright and when you use the lithium 16500 batteries it has great run time as well.  The one I bought gets thrown around in my jeep and still looks great. The only thing I wish it has was a better quality clip.  The metal is a little flimsy and eventually doesn't hold as tight.  Other than that its great.,Y,N,,,

B00828MZ3W,Will this work for BIKE?,Got this light for a great price and even operating on a single AA battery (not the 14500 3.6v Li-on optional battery which should be a big boost over the 1.2-1.5v NiMh AA battery.  Assuming the driver is not underrated for the batteries the manufacturer spec'd it for.  Will find out soon and let you know.  Of note....on the AA battery this is as bright as my Mag-lite XL50.  Also unlike the Mag-lite the light turns off between each mode.  It goes: High - Off - Low - Off - Strobe - Off.  Orange rubber button cover does not glow in the dark which is a feature I favor.  The sliding focus barrel seems a little loosely machined nothing major just the machinist in me going hmmm could have been done a little better.  I also cannot comment on performance in wet environments.  Overall an excellent buy for those not wanting to spend a small to medium sized fortune on a tactical style flashlight that will likely never see use in a life and death situation.Got the 14500 batteries a few days ago.  The flashlight is now definitely brighter than the mag-lite XL50 (137 lumens).  Will get noticeably warm (not hot) when used on high setting for extended periods.  One seriously bright flashlight especially for less than $10!  Would love to see a waterproof version of this that would operate on multi-cells.  2x 14500 or even a pair of 123s for longer battery life and more lumens.  This light would remain a good pocket carry light even then.,Y,N,,,
B00828MZ3W,Will this work for BIKE?,The lens goes past the guard and it will scratch over time. Otherwise its a pretty solid light I like it still.,Y,N,,,
B00828MZ3W,Will this work for BIKE?,This is a BRIGHT light for $4.00!  The light can focus in tight or go to flood... and it will strobe when the button cap is pressed lightly! FOUR BUCKS?! Buy it!,Y,N,,,
B00828MZ3W,Will this work for BIKE?,For me it is just not satisfying enough quality an I would rather have it cost a little more and not be lacking in fit and finish. But it does put out a lot of light and it is neat how you can focus the beam. I own three of these and will stick them in the car and forget about them. If they are stolen I won't be sad like I would for a nicer light.For my own personal use and feelings I would give it 3 stars. I am giving it four because it is inexpensive and that will work for a lot of people.,Y,N,,,
B00828MZ3W,Will this work for BIKE?,There are a variety of these Cree flashlights that all look similar sold by a large number of different outfits. You don't really know which model you are going to get even from the same seller but they all look the same. I've bought three and I will buy more as gifts.I'm not going to get all hung up on the lumen issue. It's a very bright light; as bright as you will need for household or outdoors uses. If the model that you get is a three-mode (low high flashing) then you'll find that the &#34;low&#34; setting is adequate for most of your needs.You can use a single AA battery with this flashlight though it won't be as bright as it would with a 14500 battery. Rechargeable (NiMH) AA batteries will produce even less light than a standard alkaline AA. If you want to go with the 14500 batteries I recommend that you spend more for the Tenergy battery/charger combo (about $30). The generic unprotected batteries will not last through many charges and they will probably leak and ruin the flashlight's internals. Even if they don't leak they will wear out and you'll be waiting for new ones to ship from Hong Kong the next month.The &#34;zoom&#34; is a great feature though the widest setting is not as wide as you'll find on a lot of larger flashlights or LED lights with the &#34;bulb&#34; protruding. Obviously the further away you are the wider the beam will be.As I said I own three of these. On one of them the lens protrudes beyond the case which potentially allows the lens to be scratched. The quality of the anodise coating is somewhat wanting and there are exposed specks. You'll find that the coating scratches fairly easily. The batteries load from the end opposite the lens where the switch is. Do not try to unscrew the lens end or you will ruin the flashlight.Aside from the price and amount of light produced it's the *quality* of the light produced that impresses me the most. It's a very clear white light. If you are used to LED flashlights you'll notice the difference immediately. However the light contains a lot of infrared (like the old &#34;bulb&#34; flashlights) and it will impair your night vision much more than the &#34;cool&#34; light of the LED.With a fully-charged 14500 the battery lasts about an hour at the &#34;high&#34; setting with continuous use. It also gets warm. The &#34;low&#34; setting runs for about four hours continuously without warming. I generally keep it on &#34;low&#34; and bump it up to &#34;high&#34; only if I need it. The &#34;low&#34; setting is more than enough light to find a path when hiking or illuminate a task at home -- especially if the beam is kept tight. I haven't found the &#34;flash&#34; setting to be particularly useful.After eight months I've found no issue with the light's operation. The switch continues to work on all of them and they haven't gone intermittent. There's been some scratching of the case and lens from normal use but nothing that affects the function significantly. I don't expect that it will last a lifetime but I've got my money's worth out of it already.,Y,N,,,
B00828MZ3W,Will this work for BIKE?,Next time you buy a flashlight you will promise me that you will look at the LM (lumens).  300 is soooo good!  You will almost be embarrassed about how bright you are at the camp sight.,Y,N,,,
B00828MZ3W,Will this work for BIKE?,Using just a single commom AA battery this light is very bright when compaired with lights made from aluminum like Mag lights. These lights are sturdy and durable and can be used for a variety of purposes such as a front handle bar mounted bike light when used with a universal adjustable bike mount made just for LED Flashlights. I am not sure how durable the pushbutton switch is but it works very well and certainly better then slide switches.,Y,N,,,

B000RSOV50,will this charge 18650 batteries also?,So many times I would grab a set of batteries to put in my camera flash... and because 1 of the 4 batteries was not up to snuff I was dead in the water. With this charger you know which battery may cause you problems and you can recondition it. I will never buy a charger that doesn't give feed back again. This charger is also very compact so good things do come in small packages.,N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,will this charge 18650 batteries also?,I got this for Christmas (it was on my list) to go with some new Eneloop Rechargeable Batteries (also on my list).  I decided after so many wasted batteries in the kids' toys that it was time to switch to rechargeables.  I did some research and found that Eneloop Rechargeables seemed to be the most popular with a lot of good reviews.  Also during my research this charger kept coming up in reviews as one of the best for the money so I gave it a try.  I had read to stay away from dumb chargers that just charge without monitoring the battery and go with a smart charger like the La Crosse.I really like how you can control each battery's charge method and speed.  I have been using the slowest speed to try to preserve the batteries as long as I can and I have found that this charger makes it very easy to do.  It also has a lot of other features like discharging testing and refreshing batteries while also measuring their capacity.  A lot of great stuff for a very reasonable price.  I printed a small reference card for this charger from the web and had my wife laminate it (on a laminator she got for Christmas) which is great to keep near the charger.  Very happy with both the Eneloop Batteries and the La Crosse Charger.,N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,will this charge 18650 batteries also?,"I've owned a variety of nice chargers over the years for specialty batteries (model airplane batteries) but AA and AAA chargers always seemed cheap to me.  They all had a little light that would go off at the end of a charge if you were lucky.  I've had a charger like that for years and was tired of it.  I got used to a nice display and being told information about my battery from the other chargers i've owned.  I did some looking on Amazon and found two frontrunners for the job.  The ""ultimate"" AA/AAA charger seems to be the Maha Powerex MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzer.  I read others' reviews and the consensus seems to be that while it does do ""everything"" it's a pain to use.  So the BC-700 to the rescue....This charger is relatively small and can be used by a complete newbie.  If you simply pop batteries in and walk away the charger will default to the lowest 200mA charge setting and fully charge your batteries.  If you want more choices you can press the ""current"" button within 8 seconds of putting batteries in to raise the charge current to either 500 or 700mA.  If you press the 1-2-3-4 buttons... you can set different current for each battery.  If  you press the 1-2-3-4 buttons too many times your doctor will call to inform you that you have OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).  Just kidding...The charger also has ""modes.""  The modes allow not only charging but also special combinations of discharge/charge functionality.  For example old batteries may have developed a ""memory"" and don't hold a charge very well.  This charger has a refresh mode that will attempt to bring the batteries back from the dead.  It does this by charging/discharging until it does not sense an increase in battery capacity.  It also has a ""test"" mode that allows you to test battery capacity.  The modes also work with the 1-2-3-4 buttons so you can charge batteries while testing others.  Think of it as 4 individual chargers in one box.  This also means you can charge only one battery if you need to or any number in any slot.  Very flexible.The display is pretty easy to read and will show battery voltage and capacity.  It will also show how long the charger has been running and the charging current.  You can cycle through this info easily with the display button.Overall this is an excellent charger especially for $30.  The overall construction isn't top notch but i feel it's excellent at this price.  At it's most simple you plunk in your batteries and walk away.  When each cell reads ""Full"" on the LCD charging is all done and you didn't even have to hit a button.  If you're more of a battery geek like me you'll love the extra modes and the extra info the charger tells you.  At this price even if you don't use the ""fancy"" stuff you'll still end up with a great charger.  I like it can you tell? :o)It takes about 10 hours to charge a dead AA at the lowest current setting.  If you crank it up to 700mA it will charge in about 3 hours.  The smaller AAAs charge even faster.  If you need a quicker charge take a look at the BC-9009.  It's basically the same as this one but can charge all four batteries at 1000mA or just two at 1800mA.  Enjoy!",N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,will this charge 18650 batteries also?,It has various charge rates so you can choose a slower rate for max battery life but also faster charge rate for those times when you need to charge more quickly.  It also has conditioning capabilities.,N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,will this charge 18650 batteries also?,"Great to be able to see the charge level. I also like the fact that it says ""FULL"" when done and it will maintain the charge with a trickle charge till you take them out.",N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,will this charge 18650 batteries also?,This is a very versatile charger with the ability to discharge then recharge batteries. It also will condition a battery by cycling through the charge-discharge-recharge cycle till maximum charge is determined. It has three charging rates from 200ma to 700ma for optimum charging. It will also show you the voltage for each battery. All batteries operate on their own cycle so that you can condition one while charging another. Excellent!,N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,will this charge 18650 batteries also?,I like the fact that you can charge one battery at a time and you can also test batteries before charging.,N,N,,,

B00002262M,"will it accommodate my tool stand: 28"" x 26""? The PM1000 was exactly 2"" short on the sides. :(","The stand is now under my Sprunger Tilting Arbor saw.  If you know of Sprunger they went out in the 50s or 60s you know these tools are heavy.  With the stand under my saw it is easy to roll around even on carpet.  The levers used to engage the steerable wheels are foot pressed and released and beefy enough to stand usage over time.  Some reviewers knocked them as being made of plastic but we all know there are all sorts of plastics and grades and these are good quality.  As a side note should they break which is unlikely they are easy to replace.  There is one bolt that holds them in place.  Now the negative - the directions.  I suggest you ignore them.  On the bench assemble the four corners as per the picture in the manual and the picture on the box.  Orient the levels facing in so they won't be a tripping hazard in the shop.  Measure the base of your tool.  Ignore the manual suggesting you add 1"" in each dimension.  Spot on or a 1/4"" or so over in each dimension works better.  There are 4 long and 4 short rails.  I achieved the required dimensions using only the 4 long rails so the extra bolts were installed too since there are plenty of holes to do so.  I kept the short rails taped to a piece of the box so they won't become one of those ""what are these for"" parts that get thrown out and someday ""did I throw those out"" parts.  All-in-all I'm happy with this base.  BTW the Amazon ad lists both 400 and 500 pound capacity.  The box shows 500.UPDATE - I ordered a second for my jointer and due to the dimensions it required all 4 large rails and 2 of the shorter rails.  The jointer weighs 90 pounds the stand about 10 and the plywood top about 5.  With this 105 pounds it rolls around just fine though not quite as smoothly as the much heavier table saw where the stand was built of the 4 large rails and none of the shorter rails.",Y,Y,,,
B00002262M,"will it accommodate my tool stand: 28"" x 26""? The PM1000 was exactly 2"" short on the sides. :(","I bought this to use with a 6"" Ridgid Jointer/Planner. Another reviewer had bought this for a similar adaptation. You receive 4 long sides and 4 shorter sides. I used to shorts (12"") for the end pieces and a 12"" and an 18"" (long) piece for the sides but to bolt the 12 & 18 together only left 3 overlapping holes and I felt this arrangement to be weak. I added a couple of my own bolts and reverse bolted the two remaining 18"" pieces on their reverse side (not designed for this adaptation but it worked well) to the side frames overlapping the 12 & 18 piece. This change made for a strong frame which holds/moves the 225 lb machine easily. The two front locking wheels are of good quality and do the job well. The rear wheels are straight line but solid. This is the third rack of this type (different brands) I have purchased and I built two other racks myself where store-bought was not an option. I rate this 4 out of five because although it may cover all sizes in its advertised range some configurations may not be as stable as others and may require a bit of ingenuity on your part.",Y,Y,,,

B00002262M,"will it accommodate my tool stand: 28"" x 26""? The PM1000 was exactly 2"" short on the sides. :(",The band saw has the cast-iron extension block for 12-inch re-sawing capability which adds weight and increased the top heavy condition of the tool. The entire assembly is well designed and the instructions are clear. (I scanned them a printed them 2X.) however the recommendation to allow 1-inch clearance on the sides didn't seem necessary. With assistance I lay the band saw on wood 2x4-inch strips and assembled the base to the bottom of the band saw. With a hoist I raised the saw to vertical. (I'm 80 and don't have the ability to lift the 270 lb. plus weight.)For a flush fit on the short side I cut one inch off of the steel bars with a 7-1/4-inch ferrous saw blade on my miter saw. I may be over protective but I clamped the bars down to cut them and wore safety glasses face protector and leather gloves. It was a tight fit but I was able to fit both sides of the mobile base to the band saw without modification. I added eight  1/4-inch bolts through the mobile base to the steel enclosed base of the band saw which made it an integral part of the saw. I took pictures of the completed assembly to add the product photos but couldn't find a way to add them for the base.,Y,N,,,
B00002262M,"will it accommodate my tool stand: 28"" x 26""? The PM1000 was exactly 2"" short on the sides. :(",I put a Jet 14&quot; closed stand bandsaw on this stand.  It was easy to assemble and it rolls very nicely.  Because of the bandsaw's high center of gravity the stand can get a bit &quot;tippy&quot; when you are in the wheels down position.  The easy adjustablity of the stand leaves the option of making the stand bigger and putting in a plywood base for more stability.  This is a great addition to a small shop or garage shop where you can't leave your machines out all the time.,Y,N,,,

I was going  to buy the Shop Fox but their heavy duty model was more $$$ and it was at  least 1/2&quot; too short in one dimension!,Y,N,,,
B00002262M,"will it accommodate my tool stand: 28"" x 26""? The PM1000 was exactly 2"" short on the sides. :(",The base came with the ALUMINUM cam levers!! I think HTC got the message on the plastic levers it formerly offered with this kit. The new lift/release levers are now just as rugged as the rest of the kit and should last a lifetime. Although the price has been adjusted accordingly for the upgraded cam levers this kit is still WELL WORTH IT!  Just finished setting up the base for my Jet JJ-6CSX jointer and I couldn't be happier with the extreme mobility and smoothness offered by this kit. Contrary to another reviewer's comments regarding the poor performance of the 4-wheel design this base enables me to EASILY manuever my jointer into and out of extremely tight spaces within my small shop. The manueverability is every bit as good as the 3-wheel base on my Dewalt table saw.  The instructions were very clear and the unit went together without a hitch. However the Jet jointer stand has 2  L-shaped hold-down brackets for mounting the base to the floor that necessitate a slight modification to the mobile base. These brackets are centered on the opposing short sides of the jointer stand and create a pivot point that causes the machine to rock back an forth in the mobile base. The bracket positioning also prevents the jointer stand from being bolted directly to the HTC base for safety. The HTC base has mounting points in the corners but not along the sides. To get around these issues I simply cut a 1/2&quot; plywood blank to snugly fit the dimensions of the assembled base and rabbeted the edges to clear the nuts that protrude through the inside of the frame. The plywood can then be bolted to all 4 corners of the mobile base and to the brackets on the jointer stand. Now the unit is ROCK SOLID!  Thanks to everyone who took the time to write these reviews. I am very pleased with my purchase and will undoubtedly be back for more!JW  Austin TX,Y,N,,,

B0064EICKG,"I have 1/4"" oak over standard 3/8"" sheetrock (the back of a built-in cabinet is 1/4"" oak). Will this stud finder penetrate the oak and sheetrock?",After buying an older house I originally bought a Stanley stud finder from Wal-Mart primarily because it had a deep mode claimed to penetrate 1.5 inches into the wall and I anticipated old-style lath-and-plaster wall construction. That Stanley turned out to be both useless and extremely annoying as you can read in my other review of it. After reading all the positive reviews for this Franklin unit I coughed up the dough to buy one. Well I put it against my walls and squeezed the switch and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING happens. No lights at all light up no matter where I move it to. I was extremely disappointed to say the least. I thought perhaps I was sent a dead unit. But I took both of my stud finders to my dad's house to give them a fair test on his modern sheetrock walls. The Stanley might have been slightly better there than at my house but was still annoying and unreliable. This Franklin one woke up and worked almost perfectly there. It was easy to see where the studs where repeatable higher and lower on the wall. In a couple places something in the wall was tripping it up and making all the lights come on over a wider area... but I'm willing to believe there was actually something in the wall causing that effect at least. It wasn't a random thing like the Stanley unit always does. The reader should not necessarily read this review and conclude the Franklin absolutely will not work on lath-and-plaster walls. The more I look into it the more it appears my walls are rough-sawn 1 inch lumber nailed to the studs and the surface covered with some type of thick paper material instead of plaster. And then panelling or other sheet type material laid over that in many places. I never heard of a house built like this anywhere else. Unlike one other reviewer I did not find anything unnatural or uncomfortable about the grip or switch on this Franklin.,Y,Y,,,

I know they're sheetrock covered with that spatter-paint crap (its an apartment so I can't redo them) but they aren't plaster.  Still I do have trouble getting a reading sometimes with this thing.

B0064EICKG,"I have 1/4"" oak over standard 3/8"" sheetrock (the back of a built-in cabinet is 1/4"" oak). Will this stud finder penetrate the oak and sheetrock?",First things first with any stud finder and being a male.... the first thing you do is stick this to your chest in front of your significant other. That will let them know that the finder does work and you are indeed a stud. Now that that is finished....When this thing is working it works great. Just like the product videos show you hold the button down run it over the wall and the lights show up where it is. It makes marking the walls a breeze and I've had not nearly as much trouble hitting things behind drywall as in the past. That alone to me is worth the price paid. When its working (which has been about 80% of the time for me) it shows 3 lights for a standard 2x4.However that being said I have been having an issue occasionally when trying to find a stud it shows 5-6 lights. I've assumed that it might be something metal behind or some wiring that would cause interference but that is not the case. I've tried different studs and found the same issue. Simple enough to fix you just pull it away from the wall about 1/4 of an inch and it shows the lights like it should. I just found this out today.I dont regret buying it I won't return it just had to figure out the issue with that. I feel much more confident using this than I ever did a cheaper version or knocking.,Y,N,,,
B0064EICKG,"I have 1/4"" oak over standard 3/8"" sheetrock (the back of a built-in cabinet is 1/4"" oak). Will this stud finder penetrate the oak and sheetrock?",Works well but I wish it had more LED lights closer together.  They are spaced about 1/2 inch apart so that is about as close as you get on the measurment.  If you know it is a 2x4 and you move it back and forth you can narrow it down to within about 1/8 to 1/4 inch on each side.  Moving it causes some variation in the reading so it is not exact.  The handle is okay but a little difficult for reach and overhead work.  It is very light weight but you still notice it after a lot of overhead work.  Depth penetration is impressive on lots of different materials (better than a standard stud finder).  You have to hold the button in which can get tiring.  The handle shape and holding the button in kept me from using it for more than 4 locations of overhead work at once.,Y,N,,,

B000RSOV50,Can this be used to test non-rechargable batteries also?,Most chargers can charge batteries just fine but this one goes well above and beyond other battery chargers.Not all chargers can charge AA and AAA at the same time; this one can.Some chargers require you to charge in multiples of two; this one lets you charge any quantity of batteries you want.Most chargers don't have a &#34;refresh&#34; function which performs a full discharge and recharge; this one does.Hardly any chargers list the current voltage of the batteries and as you can probably guess this one also does that.I feel a lot safer using this device than previous chargers. It's got a lot of neat features built in and I'm sure it is a lot safer than some cheap chargers I've used in the past that overcharged some batteries and made them corrode and leak ruining both the batteries and the charger.If you still are looking for some batteries now to pair with this I'd highly recommend the Sanyo Eneloops. They have very long lives and can withstand many recharge cycles and self-discharge much slower in periods of disuse. I have also used the AmazonBasics rechargeables and while not quite as good as the Eneloops they are a good value and are much easier on the wallet without sacrificing too much quality.If your budget will allow for this charger just get it. It's a little pricier but well worth the premium to the cheap-o chargers that will likely need to be replaced quickly anyway. I am very happy with this little gem; five stars.,N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,Can this be used to test non-rechargable batteries also?,I have a number of battery chargers and some are simple timer based. Some are computer based but suffer from falsely defining some batteries as defective. This charger has charged every NiMh battery I have (about 100) without any problems. I also really like that you can test any battery and refresh (charge/discharge cycle) any battery. If you have a lot of NiMh or NiCad batteries of all types and capacities then this charger is highly recommended. Each slot can perform any function on each battery you can charge one while refreshing another. The display is very readable and function change is easy. Overall one of the best NiMh and NiCad battery chargers that I've used.,N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,Can this be used to test non-rechargable batteries also?,It has various charge rates so you can choose a slower rate for max battery life but also faster charge rate for those times when you need to charge more quickly.  It also has conditioning capabilities.,N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,Can this be used to test non-rechargable batteries also?,"I've owned a variety of nice chargers over the years for specialty batteries (model airplane batteries) but AA and AAA chargers always seemed cheap to me.  They all had a little light that would go off at the end of a charge if you were lucky.  I've had a charger like that for years and was tired of it.  I got used to a nice display and being told information about my battery from the other chargers i've owned.  I did some looking on Amazon and found two frontrunners for the job.  The ""ultimate"" AA/AAA charger seems to be the Maha Powerex MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzer.  I read others' reviews and the consensus seems to be that while it does do ""everything"" it's a pain to use.  So the BC-700 to the rescue....This charger is relatively small and can be used by a complete newbie.  If you simply pop batteries in and walk away the charger will default to the lowest 200mA charge setting and fully charge your batteries.  If you want more choices you can press the ""current"" button within 8 seconds of putting batteries in to raise the charge current to either 500 or 700mA.  If you press the 1-2-3-4 buttons... you can set different current for each battery.  If  you press the 1-2-3-4 buttons too many times your doctor will call to inform you that you have OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).  Just kidding...The charger also has ""modes.""  The modes allow not only charging but also special combinations of discharge/charge functionality.  For example old batteries may have developed a ""memory"" and don't hold a charge very well.  This charger has a refresh mode that will attempt to bring the batteries back from the dead.  It does this by charging/discharging until it does not sense an increase in battery capacity.  It also has a ""test"" mode that allows you to test battery capacity.  The modes also work with the 1-2-3-4 buttons so you can charge batteries while testing others.  Think of it as 4 individual chargers in one box.  This also means you can charge only one battery if you need to or any number in any slot.  Very flexible.The display is pretty easy to read and will show battery voltage and capacity.  It will also show how long the charger has been running and the charging current.  You can cycle through this info easily with the display button.Overall this is an excellent charger especially for $30.  The overall construction isn't top notch but i feel it's excellent at this price.  At it's most simple you plunk in your batteries and walk away.  When each cell reads ""Full"" on the LCD charging is all done and you didn't even have to hit a button.  If you're more of a battery geek like me you'll love the extra modes and the extra info the charger tells you.  At this price even if you don't use the ""fancy"" stuff you'll still end up with a great charger.  I like it can you tell? :o)It takes about 10 hours to charge a dead AA at the lowest current setting.  If you crank it up to 700mA it will charge in about 3 hours.  The smaller AAAs charge even faster.  If you need a quicker charge take a look at the BC-9009.  It's basically the same as this one but can charge all four batteries at 1000mA or just two at 1800mA.  Enjoy!",N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,Can this be used to test non-rechargable batteries also?,This is the best charger that I have used to date. It is filled with features and when used properly it should not harm your batteries.,N,N,,,
B000RSOV50,Can this be used to test non-rechargable batteries also?,I like the fact that you can charge one battery at a time and you can also test batteries before charging.,N,N,,,

B0000225E0,Would you use this for a framing/finish nail gun?,I just can't stand dealing with PVC hoses or coil hoses. So these are the way to go.  3/8 ID air line with 3/8 male NPT brass ends.  Quality hose a good price.,Y,N,,,
B0000225E0,Would you use this for a framing/finish nail gun?,This is a very good air hose strong and good quality. Not as flexible as I would have liked but that is only because of how thick the hose is.,Y,N,,,
B0000225E0,Would you use this for a framing/finish nail gun?,This goodyear hose ~ IS NOT GOODYEAR !I just got off the phone with a goodyear rep who told me there is a knockoff company if FL.. Somehow they use the name goodyear but the real goodyear will have a TM (some kind of symbol) between the good and the year..I own this hose..  I called because my new compressor says rubber will not hold up to synthetic compressor lube.. Unless it is over 36 percent nitrile..  I cant seem to find anything about this hose in tghat respect..Guess I will keep trying.. If it were a goodyear hose I would have had my answer.. The real hoses would probably cost a lot more..Butit would have been nice to know what I was buying in the first place..,Y,N,,,
B0000225E0,Would you use this for a framing/finish nail gun?,its okay.  very little give and very stiff.  its tough for sure and I would recommend it for sure if it was going to be the air line in your gas station the car run over to notify you that someone's at the full serve pump.  wait do they still do that?!used plenty of air lines and ease of flexibility isn't something you think of when you buy a line.  its cool it was cheap so just a head up.,Y,N,,,
B0000225E0,Would you use this for a framing/finish nail gun?,For YEARS I have tripped and fumbled over around and through my old air hoses in my barn...  they had memory...  when it would get cold they were stiff and impossible to manage.Finally bought this rubber hose - wow.  Just lays where you put it and when you move it - it stays there too.  No memory issues and very flexible in the cold (18F).Buy one - you won't be sorry!,Y,N,,,
B0000225E0,Would you use this for a framing/finish nail gun?,This is a good durable hose that is to say it is exactly what you would expect. It does not tangle but be aware that it may twist or kink which can be frustrating. Make sure you lay it out before attaching it to air or else it becomes difficult to work with. The 1/4 inch connectors are pretty standard and allow for connectors to screw on as one would hope and expect. This hose will probably not change your world unless you are using one of those cheap plastic coil hoses in which case it might.,Y,N,,,
B0000225E0,Would you use this for a framing/finish nail gun?,I use this hose primarily for my nail guns.  It is nice and heavy so it lays flat when in use.  It also winds up well unlike a pvc or plastic hose.  The ends are installed well.  This product is clearly superior to Chinese knock-offs that you may find at a big-box store.  Don't try to save $4; buy this one!,Y,N,,,

B006VPPERC,Is this flashlight suitable for scuba diving up to 30 meters? If I get 2 of them do you think I will have enough light to film something 60 inches awa,This is really an unbelievable bargain for about 3 bucks a piece.  Okay they are not one of my $40 lights but these work just fine for what they are...an inexpensive flashlight that if you lose you won't cry about.I have one of these in almost very draw in my house and one sits by each door.  I have a lot of wildlife out and before I go out when it is dark I shine the flashlight so all the bobcats and his friends will take a little hike.  I don't want them to be scared by me and I certainly do not want them to scare me.I have had many if these lights for 3 years now and every one (to my surprise) works perfectly except one which I have to shake a few times which then works perfectly.These lights come from China so do not eat them.  :)Expect to wait a couple weeks for delivery.  Oh what I also like about them is I can give them out to any friend that admires them.  It is a lovely gift that everyone appreciates.,N,N,,,
B006VPPERC,Is this flashlight suitable for scuba diving up to 30 meters? If I get 2 of them do you think I will have enough light to film something 60 inches awa,this is the second i've purchased the first was perfect the second one zoom is not tight and will slide forward and backward a little too easy not a huge deal and i still think this is one of the best flashlight deals out there.  I own two similar surefire flashlights and you can tell the surefire is of better quality but for 1/8th the price you cannot beat this flashlight.  Put one in your car junk drawer nightstand bag whatever.  It works on standard AA's.  I cannot speak to the longevity of the battery life because i haven't used them enough but so far i'm quite pleased.,N,N,,,
B006VPPERC,Is this flashlight suitable for scuba diving up to 30 meters? If I get 2 of them do you think I will have enough light to film something 60 inches awa,The flashlight is probably around 70 to 80 lumens not no 300. But certainly bright enough so that in the dark a person could not see you if it's shinning at them.Its got four different settings bright low strobe and an s.o.s signal which is a feature that I am still trying to learn how to work. But to get it to do an s.o.s flashing signal I think has something to do with holding down the clicker button (maybe).It looks and feels like it's made fairly well. It's a little bit too thick to fit nicely into a pocket comfortably but it's pretty lite weight.Its got a belt clip that works fine.You can widen the beam which forms a wide circular beam of light with artifacts around it or adjust it to make it into a smaller point of light that looks like a micro chip.I think these are selling for so cheap because these perhaps were their experimental models that they're trying to sell to break even and not lose money on.To turn it from bright to low and to strobe you don't have to turn the flashlight all the way off. You just barely press the button and it changes from setting to setting.The best thing so far about this light that's got most of the more expensive flashlights of this size beat is that it can tail stand.,N,N,,,
B006VPPERC,Is this flashlight suitable for scuba diving up to 30 meters? If I get 2 of them do you think I will have enough light to film something 60 inches awa,I was pleasantly surprised by the brightness and general quality of the light considering the price.  If you discount price though it doesn't come close to the quality of even moderately expensive lights like Guidesman. The focusing mechanism is a slide of the lens. It works and it stays in place pretty well but is not as smooth as it should be.  I thought I broke mine when trying to screw the lens off.  I was able to screw it back on and it is fairly solid now. You can focus the light well enough to see the circuit board on the wall.  The throw distance is also quite good. For general use the light works well.  The button on the back is precise and seems well built. Overall it is a great light for the price.For self defense purposes you would be better off using something else.  The light has crenellations on the lens but they don't stick out past the lens enough.  Second the light is not set to be a spot light with the lens pushed down.  You have to pull the lens out to focus so it won't work very well to blind someone unless you focus it (which requires time and two hands).  Finally I do not think the lens mounting is strong enough to withstand more than one real hit.  For defense you can get much better lights for less than $10.,N,N,,,
B006VPPERC,Is this flashlight suitable for scuba diving up to 30 meters? If I get 2 of them do you think I will have enough light to film something 60 inches awa,For a single AA  flashlight this is very bright and for the price well I just don't think you can beat it for a great bargain.  I just put another one in my Amazon shopping cart as I intend to have several spread around the house and car just in case I need one.  I don't think that you will regret buying one of these to keep in your pocket or purse.,N,N,,,
B006VPPERC,Is this flashlight suitable for scuba diving up to 30 meters? If I get 2 of them do you think I will have enough light to film something 60 inches awa,"I got this ""no-name"" flashlight only because of the generally positive reviews and I wanted to see it for myself! For starters I'm a ""flashlight snob"". I'll generally pay up to $80 for a light just because I know I'm getting a quality product that will stand the test of time. Does THIS light offer that??? Who knows.Many reviewers will look the other way at its flaws simply because of the price. I can see that point perfectly. Actually I wish I'd paid more attention to the description and got one with more than one mode.Anyway it does what it says. Click the cap and it goes on. Click again and it goes off. I will say that tightening the tail cap after replacing a battery is a pain in the butt. It's thin and flimsy and won't go on without a fight!At least it'll run on a 14500 lithium which WILL give higher brightness. I honestly can't tell very well ... but I don't think it puts out 300 lumens even on a 14500.When the zoom feature is in normal position the beam is big and wide. It's also BLUE in color. This is a useable beam for anything indoors...BUT...it would be WAY too bright to use it in the middle of the night when your eyes are not adjusted for bright light. As far as outdoors goes it's not great. It suppose you can see okay in front of you...and MAYBE for 50ft? But anything beyond that you'd certainly need to use a 14500 battery. Even then...it's only useable up to about 70ft. The lights I use generally are good for over 100 YARDS!When the zoom is pulled all the way out...you get this RIDICULOUS beam which is a bright SQUARE blob of light --- this is the shape of the LED you're seeing. You see the exact same image with ALL these cheap zooming lights. I think it's dumb and it serves no particular purpose. I WILL admit that with the zoom feature it throws this ""square beam"" extremely far. It accomplishes this by use of its aspheric lens. It's not the regular type of glass lens that a quality light has but is in the shape of a half circle (like a magnifying glass). I have other lights that will throw just as far but when doing so you get a regular beam - which is wide as well as bright. The square beam on this light although not quite as noticeable when shining out to its limit is very small. So even when it's pointing st something at a great distance it's hard for your eyes to get a fix on it or anything around it due to the ""tininess"" of the beam. Does that make sense?Who or what would I recommend this light for?Anyone who needs a light in a pinch. The closer the range the better. Searching for something in your house or in the car or under the hood of your car.Who WOULDN'T I recommend this light for?Anyone who needs a light for professional use. If I worked as a security guard...a law enforcement officer...on the tarmac at an airport...or was involved in search and rescue...............I would be ASHAMED to carry a light of this cheapness! I would never show it off to friends or boast about it to anyone. Because I know quality and I wouldn't want anyone who needs a new flashlight to THINK that this is the type of light they would need or want.If you need something quick and you don't give a hoot if you lose it crush it crack it or drop it in a manhole...then this flashlight is for you. If you're looking for even the slightest bit of quality...look somewhere else...and look BEYOND $30!That's how I see it.",N,N,,,
B006VPPERC,Is this flashlight suitable for scuba diving up to 30 meters? If I get 2 of them do you think I will have enough light to film something 60 inches awa,This flashlight is really bright.

I was able to easily figure out how much the TV uses computer printer and all sorts of other gadgets in our house (including if there are ""energy vampires"" of items drawing electricity even when turned off).  It can display how many Watts the device is drawing at that moment or kilowatt hours so that you can still measure usage of items like the refrigerator that use electricity sporadically rather than steady and all at once.  I'm not sure about all the other buttons but those two features alone make this well worth the money.

When the electricity goes out and that can be often at particular times of the year.  I keep a 4500 watt generator handy for emergencies.  To determine best how to distribute the electricity from the generator power source I checked all the electrical power usage from the appliances I'll use during the storms including the refrigerator freezer Security Alarm Climate controlled rooms with dehydrators and filtered air for our child small heaters and a few strategically placed lamps and of course the wifey-pooh's hair dryer and ""Foot-Laxer"".

B00009MDBU,will this measure the usage of 220 volt like the clothes dryer?,Over the years our electric utility has become less reliable. I've had to add UPS backup to my computers TiVo and DVR. The outages have become more frequent and more extended.Enter the need for a backup generator and transfer switch. The secret of a good install on the transfer switch is knowing what the current draw of the various items plugged in. Which is where this tool shines.Once you know which lights and outlets are on a circuit you measure the draw of every one. Add it up then I multiplied by 1.5 for circuits which have motors like the refrigerator freezer furnace washer and dryer as motors have a surge current draw when starting.Figures in hand I assigned to various circuits to one or the other side of the transfer switch keeping the total running and surge values as close to equal as possible.,N,N,,,

B00009MDBU,will this measure the usage of 220 volt like the clothes dryer?,A friend of mine had one of these and I borrowed it a couple times and then figured I should get my own.It doesn't do well with fast changes (like keeping track of my sump pump) and does strange things at hundredths of an amp - sometimes registering 0 sometimes registering more even when nothing is plugged in.But for regular devices it works wonderfully.It'd be great if they had a 220 adapter so I could test out those devices too.I've jury rigged a small extension cord because the connector is fixed to the back and so occasionally doesn't fit into a plug (like on a power strip or in one outlet of a two outlet box when the other outlet is being used).,N,Y,,,
B00009MDBU,will this measure the usage of 220 volt like the clothes dryer?,I've had mine for about two years as I write this review.  I've had experience with commercial power monitors in past years so my criteria may not be the same as yours.The huge advantage of this unit is that it gives you insight into the usage of one device or all devices plugged into a power strip.  So what was not easily knowable without this unit can now be clear.  For many readers that will be enough.The disadvantages of this unit are that it essentially only provides one number i.e. total electricity usage of a device/cord over a specific time period.  What it does not provide is usage patterns.  To get a more precise picture of usage a logging multimeter or some other instrument will be needed at a much higher price.  One example is the Fluke 287 Fluke 287 True-rms Electronics Logging W/ Trend Capture which is unfortunately about twenty times more expensive than the P3.  And one has to be comfortable with hooking up probes to live voltage when using equipment like that.I also would like a PC interface for automatic capture of the recorded usage data.I purchased this but wound up only using it a few times.  If you have a huge electrical bill and can't pinpoint why the P3 may repay its price.  If you have a reasonable idea of where your electricity usage is going it may be more effort than it's worth.  Using the P3 will make energy conservation your hobby and that may not be a bad thing but be aware that you have to put some effort into it.,N,N,,,

B000051WQV,Does this tool have a spindle lock?,This unit defines &quot;heavy duty&quot; as far as cordless screwdrivers are concerned.  Larger than your typical cordless screwdriver it is also quite a bit more powerful.  It comes with two 7.2 volt batteries fast charger two driving bits and a sturdy carrying case.The unit is made of quality materials.  All of the controls work smoothly and precisely.  The battery packs that came with the kit are also made of sturdy plastic material.  And the battery charger does indeed work as fast as advertised.  I was able to charge a depleted 7.2 volt battery in an hour.  In addition this charger can also be used to charge the other battery packs from the same manufacturer up to 14.4 volts.I have used this unit to drive wall screws into hardwood panelings for the purpose of hanging picture frames.  It handled such a light-duty application with ease.  However I did notice the same problem that a previous reviewer had mentioned: it is very easy to release the bit from the chuck.  That happened to me during the above &quot;project&quot;.  I had to get down on the floor to look for the missing bit.  However I want to acknowledge that it is also quite possible that I just did not set the bit down as far as it could go into the chuck.  In other words I am not entirely sure whether the unit has a problem or the operator just did not get the bit into the chuck deep enough.The unit is large.  Perhaps it is more than what you would want for a light-duty application such as computer repair.  Think carefully about how you will apply the tool.  My suggestion is to visit your local home improvement store and inspect the unit first.  You might be surprised to see that it is actually the same size as most cordless drills.  And just as likely you will also be impressed at what DeWalt included with the kit for the relatively low price of $99.  Given what the other manufacturers are giving you for the same price or more this one is truly quite a &quot;deal.&quot;Unlike most DeWalt equipment this one is made in China.  That does not affect the quality design or function of the tool.  Which is what this review is all about.,Y,N,,,
B000051WQV,Does this tool have a spindle lock?,"Not bad but why would I want one. So what it can driver a 3"" deck screw.  I can do that better with a cordless drill or impactdriver. This dewalt is still too big for a small screwdriver. The Milwaukee is over priced a little but it does the one thing better. Being a cordless driver. Its much smaller like a screwdriver. And you can drive a screw and then twist it like a manual screwdriver to check thightness of the screw. And dont have to worry a lot playing with the clutch so you dont strip out screws. Or like installing plastic electric plates you can screw in then turn screw just a little manually so you dont crack the plate.",Y,N,,,
B000051WQV,Does this tool have a spindle lock?,I do remodeling and this is a great tool design The tool has very good battery lifefeel torque etc. As another reviewer has noted the chuck did wobble but if you watch the bit it is not the shaft . I removed the sliding chuck ring and found the tension spring was not flat ground on the ends and the plastic sleeve below it had a casting bur left causing the wobble(it made the chuck sleeve tilt when released). I flat ground the spring ends and removed the bur and all is ok now. The shaft was not the problem.  I suppose that being made in China instead of the USA may have something to do with it. I called DeWalt and the said that to be competitive the do not make this tool here it would cost too much. He was not too concerned about the wobble because it does not cause the bit to be off center.  I should give it less than 5 stars but I like this tool so much better than anything else I have used for driving fasteners and light drilling and the fix was easy and took less than 5 minutes.I am beginning to be concerned with DeWalt's quality control.I have had several other issuses with other tools that are minor but show lack of attention to detail in manufacturing and assembly.(they do have a lot of reconditioned tools?),Y,N,,,
B000051WQV,Does this tool have a spindle lock?,This is my second Dewalt 7.2v cordless screwdriver.  Nothing wrong with the old one except the batteries died a slow death.  It was nearly a push to get a second unit v. buying batteries for the old one.  My only complaint is the bit holder will allow the bit to fall out if it is disturbed in any way while using it.  Putting it in a holder will more often than not allow the bit to fall out.  The next complaint is the battery charger will only go to 14v. so if you have other DeWalt stuff it may not charge those batteries.All in all this is a very fine tool to own.  I can't think if driving a screw without the use of this tool.  Also you can get an attachment to use as a string winder on guitars.  It really does a quick job of changing guitar strings when you use a string winding attachment.,Y,N,,,
B000051WQV,Does this tool have a spindle lock?,I have been using my Porter Cable 19.2V cordless drill as a screwdriver but the weight and size finally got to me and I purchased this DeWalt model.  I do mostly cabinetry work and needed something that is small and light to get into tight spaces.  First impression of the tool is that it is very well-made solid feel in the hand.  Although the head does not swivel to a right angleI have not found the 60 or so degree maximum angle a problem yet.  It is also nice that the kit comes with 2 rechargeable batteries.  When I bought the tool I had some reservations about the amount of torque it can generate from the 7.2V batteries especially since I have been using a 19.2V cordless drill.  After using it for a week or so I must confess that I have not encountered a situation that there hasn't been enough torque to drive a screw yet.  Oftentimes I have to reduce the torque setting so the tool doesn't drive the screw too hard.  This is a well-designed tool and I highly recommend it to anyone.,Y,N,,,
B000051WQV,Does this tool have a spindle lock?,Being a huge fan of just about all Dewalt tools this is no exception.  I love having a very handy strong and reliable cordless screwdriver.  This is a must have for anyone that does any woodworking or other diy home projects.  Very handy tool.,Y,N,,,
B000051WQV,Does this tool have a spindle lock?,Only real complaint I have with this is the chuck lock. In my impact driver I have to pull the lock away from the driver head to remove or replace a hex bit on this it goes towards the head. So if I am working and put this in to my tool pouch it has a tendency to unlock and drop out the hex bit. Get very annoying.Overall it works well. Seems to have plenty of power for what I use it for which has been setting wall plates small metal screws in vent pipe etc...

B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,I live in a house with a wall around the property and a gate that is some distance from the front door. Wiring a bell to the gate would be possible but quite inconvenient.  The reason I bought this particular chime is because it claims a operational range greater than most on the market and I needed the range.Training the push button to the chime is as simple as pushing a button on the base unit and then pressing the push button itself.While the Honeywell chime is a bit more expensive than others the materials and apparent quality are well above average.  Installation is a snap and the operational range is more than adequate for my needs.,Y,N,,,
B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,Fairly easy to assemble.  With the volume all the way up I can hear it from anywhere in the house.  Since it's portable I can also put it on the back deck when I'm working in the back yard.  I just left it on the standard ding-dong but it does have a couple other sound options.  You can also buy an additional push button(s) for other doors and an icon will blink showing you which door rung.  When you mount the push button you'll need to use a drill to get thru the plastic and wood for the tiny screws that hold it in place.,Y,N,,,

B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,Bought this unit to replace a GE 19209 wireless door chime that I purchased in February which didn't last more than a few months. We installed this Honeywell chime by the front door with the push button at the back door. We also purchased an additional push button which is installed in our driveway approximately 40-45 feet from the chime. Both push buttons work fine. I did also purchase outlet covers to go over the push buttons to protect them from rain. I thought that might've been part of the problem with the GE unit but not sure since alot of other reviewers for the GE unit also had issues with it. So far I've been happy with the performance of this unit just hope it holds up.,Y,Y,,,
B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,Got it to replace my old Heath Zenith wireless door chime.  So far so good.Both the front door button and the rear door button (I bought an extra button) were able to reach the base just fine.  While my old ones had trouble.  It looks better and more sophisticated than HZ and with more functions.  Although the manual was terrible.  It is cryptic for me try to configure the sounds for my buttons.  Took a few trial and errors.Due to the house structure one of the door buttons have to be mounted with exposure to weather.  I shall hold my breath to see how it fairs under the intense southern california sun and occasional downpour.  I wonder if I should use my silicone sealant to further seal it.,Y,Y,,,
B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,Ordered this for the same reason most folks do to install a doorbell without having wiring available.  When I found this on Amazon it looked higher end than most doorbells.  Sleek silver housing with a smoke black cover and a nice-looking push button.  I was a bit disappointed as soon as I opened the package.  The doorbell chime housing itself was much fatter than I was expecting but ah well.  But the plastic on this is not &#34;Premium&#34; so maybe something else is.First I needed to get it open to install 3 &#34;AA&#34; batteries.  To do this you have to depress and slide a flimsy black button while pulling the smoke black cover towards you.  Which means you are pushing one direction (the button) while trying to pull another (the slide).  Genius.  After a few minutes I finally got the batteries installed and moved on to the push button.So the push button just takes one CR-style battery.  Here again is where I wondered if those who designed the products actually ever used the products...even once.  To get the two halves of the push button apart you have to insert a flat blade screwdriver and pry them apart.  This is admittedly easier once the back half is securely mounted to a surface.  But when you're just holding the smallish button in your hand you can easily gouge the plastic and/or your hand trying to get this thing apart.  Here I wonder about how many times it will take a battery replacement before the unit starts to look bad from prying it apart or not snapping back together tightly.  Once I got it apart I inserted the battery but noticed there is no weather proofing inside the push button housing.Maybe the push button housing snaps together tightly enough to prevent water entry but who knows.  I know as the main button for the doorbell they can sometimes be mounted in locations exposed to the weather as was our case.  Only a few good rainstorms will tell but I'm wondering about the long-term prospects of this push button.Overall once I got everything ready the doorbell chime selections are few but good and the volume control (another really cheap feature) allows you to adjust the volume to suit your tastes.  I do wish it had a push button feature to turn it down in case you have a baby asleep etc but you can just slide the center cover back and turn it down if you wish.We paired a second push button to this unit and it worked just fine.  So it works as a wireless doorbell as intended but I was a bit disappointed in the quality and execution of the unit.,Y,Y,,,
B001CMLAZ4,Is the bell push weather proof?,My wife is 9 months pregnant this week.  She had a difficult time early in the pregnancy so we bought this early on so that she could easily get my attention if needed.  We have a small house but it is pretty sound proof when trying to communicate between upstairs and down.  This works perfectly.  She keeps the button with her or near her all the time and I can hear it go off anywhere in the house.  I use it when I am outside and she is inside.  I have concerns with the button unit being exposed to weather if it was mounted outside.  If it was on a covered porch it would be fine.  No problems with transmission or sound of the doorbell at all.  Works great for what we use it for!,Y,Y,,,

B005E48K6I,is this lighter used under the water?,Well this thing is a facsimile of a high end LED flashlight IMO but I can tell you that it's very sturdy and very bright.  Perhaps it won't last as long but if you're looking for a bright LED compact flashlight and you don't want to drop a lot of coin on it I would say you can't go wrong with this.  I would venture to say it's WAY brighter than any 20-25 dollar light you're going to find in a store.  I have a lot of flashlights and some smaller than this cost as much as 100 bucks.  It's at least worth 1/3 of that IMO.  For under 10 bucks it's a no brainer I'll likely buy more.  One thing to note high quality batteries for this flashlight will likely exceed the price of the flashlight itself.,N,N,,,
B005E48K6I,is this lighter used under the water?,This light compares very well to the SureFire flashlight I have.

In strobe mode or at full brightness this thing will temporally blind some one.I have found that I mainly use it in the low setting. Even in low it is very bright. Only need high for distance.,N,N,,,
B005E48K6I,is this lighter used under the water?,Came packaged in a plastic envelope with no manufacturers identification or instructions. Counterfeit?  Works great now but will it when I need I?.  Cost was under $10 and I guess you get what you pay for.,N,N,,,

B0000VYDHA,If this ladder is IA rated 300 lb and my own weight is (for example) 310 lb does it mean I cannot use this ladder? Thank you!,i have not had the need to ever purchase a ladder in over 50 yrs until now. As a female whose experience with ladders has been only a step stool i was kinda worried i would not be able to lift this ladder or figure out the mechanics of it. I ordered it on a friday night  it arrived on monday evening. i read the instructions in 5 minutes and put it up and used it to change a battery in the ever beeping low battery indicator on the fire alarm on a cathedral ceiling. Now I have a ladder and i am very happy with the delivery and the ease of using the ladder.,N,N,,,

B0000VYDHA,If this ladder is IA rated 300 lb and my own weight is (for example) 310 lb does it mean I cannot use this ladder? Thank you!,After borrowing my father-in-laws extension ladder seemingly countless times I decided it was high time to purchase a ladder of my own to meet my handyman needs around the house.I initially stumbled on the Werner MT-22 at my local hardware store but scoffed at the retail price of the ladder. Luckily I once again stumbled across this ladder right before the holiday season as a `Deal of the Day' on Amazon and jumped on the deal.I immediately set to work after my ladder arrived and started with my fall cleaning to remove the leaves from my homes' gutters. As an extension ladder the MT-22 works well but does have some added limitations and cumbersomeness due to the nature of ladders of this type. For example to fully extend the ladder you'll first have to unfold the ladder from its storage position by pushing in two locking pins located at the pivot-point and unfold the ladder halfway. The ladder will then be in the step-ladder configuration. To finish unfolding the ladder you'll again have to push in the locking pins at the pivot-point and finish unfolding the ladder. Because of the weight of the MT-22 it's best to finish unfolding while the ladder is lying on the ground.Extending the ladder is again in my experience best achieved by laying the ladder on the ground. Pulling the extension pins on both sides of the extension and sliding the ladder to the desired height locking the extension pins and then standing the ladder back up. In my initial uses of the ladder I found I underestimated the height of how far I'd extended the ladder and had to lower it back to ground to extend the ladder to the desired height. Again an inconvenience compared to traditional pulley-type extension ladders.One I had the ladder fully extended I did find it incredibly sturdy and easy to put my faith into even when almost fully extended. The use of two sets of legs adds some piece of mind in that at least the ladder won't likely slide sideways. However one word of caution if you plan on using this ladder to traverse to a roof or similar it's very difficult with the positioning Werner has taken with the angled legs.All in all I'm very satisfied with this product and it's an easy recommendation with the caveats that it's heavy and the angled legs can get in the way in some instances.,N,N,,,
B0000VYDHA,If this ladder is IA rated 300 lb and my own weight is (for example) 310 lb does it mean I cannot use this ladder? Thank you!,This 13 foot ladder is one I use everyday at work and has lasted for more than 6 years in good working order. It is safe and versatile acting as a standard step ladder and a mini extension ladder (in other words it opens up straight as pictured).  13' is tall enough for most one-story houses to get up on the roof and clean out gutters hang christmas lights etc...The 21 footer serves more specific purposes and although it can hold 300 pounds it also feels like it weighs 300 pounds.  whew.  buyer beware. I have both and occasionally need the taller ladder but would not recommend it to most buyers.Note of caution: as with most things common sense should be heeded when operating.  It can be potentially dangerous to your fingers if not paying attention.  Keep them on the outside of the ladders and not between the rungs when adjusting.,N,Y,,,
B0000VYDHA,If this ladder is IA rated 300 lb and my own weight is (for example) 310 lb does it mean I cannot use this ladder? Thank you!,Bought this for the flexibility and ease of transport.  It fit without any trouble in the back of the vehicle and was very easy to handle with 1 person.  Being able to use it as a stair ladder or with the included braces to use it as scaffolding support was very attractive. The weakness is in the extension ability.  It is very difficult to fully extend the ladder to 19 feet.  Basically your only option is to half-extend it on the ground and once you have it standing push it the rest of the way up.  This becomes very difficult as this ladder does not have the typical pulley system found on regular extension ladders.  It also cannot accept the Werner Quick-Click Stabilizer.  The stabilizer would normall make window and gutter jobs a piece of cake.  Also with the angled legs I am not sure of this ladders ability to accept a leveler.  This all coupled with the flexing of 4 seperate pieces prompted me to return it for a Werner 24 foot fiberglass extension that I am completely happy with. (...),N,N,,,
B0000VYDHA,If this ladder is IA rated 300 lb and my own weight is (for example) 310 lb does it mean I cannot use this ladder? Thank you!,"I bought this ladder a year ago when Lowes was running a special on them. I do not own a truck and I needed a ladder that could get me to the 2nd story eaves and be compact enough to fit inside a car. This ladder fits the bill and works very well.I have noticed many complaints on here in regards to the ladder's weight. Yes it is heavy and it is a pain to move when fully extended. However I do not see how a ladder of this type could possibly be light. Normal extension ladders consist of two long pieces. The pieces are connected by a hook that you can manipulate with a pull string. Multi-ladders however are actually 4 pieces as there is a ladder within a ladder on each end that are connected with a sliding bolt. You can't manipulate these sliding bolts with a long string. There is more hardware and more pieces that have to meet the specifications of the 300 lb. load rating. Add to that the nature of simple physics. When fully extended the ladder works as a lever against you. Which means that it requires more strength to lift the 40+ pounds the further it is away from you. I don't see where Werner is at fault for this.I don't like heights and I have never felt comfortable on a lightweight aluminum extension ladder. I do not like the little ladder slide that occurs when climbing before it settles on a good secure position. The Werner ladder has very wide feet spacing and the weight helps secure the ladder against the house. I can try and wiggle it when on the ground and the ladder doesn't move. When it is fully extended in step ladder mode I can reach the 1st story eaves around my porch without issue. It gives me full stability and I am not stuck because I have nothing to lean the ladder against to perform this task.With every tool purchase there is give and take. I wish I could say this ladder is the ""only one you need"" but I would be lying. I have a 13' multi-ladder I use for most items inside the house. This one meets my needs for the upper stories and for odd jobs I might have to do on the stairway where I have a very high ceiling that I cannot reach with the smaller one. It is heavy and cumbersome to move when fully extended (that is the give) but I can transport it in my car and store it in my ever more limiting space (the take). One word of caution if you purchase accessories for this. Keep in mind that Amazon accessory recommendations are based on what customers purchase with an item. It is not based on the manufacturer's specifications. Not all Werner accessories such as stabilizer bars are interchangeable with all types of Werner ladders. Make sure that any accessory purchased is listed as compatible with this model of ladder.",N,N,,,
B0000VYDHA,If this ladder is IA rated 300 lb and my own weight is (for example) 310 lb does it mean I cannot use this ladder? Thank you!,I have used this ladder for a number of projects over the last couple of months and cannot say enough good things about it.  The ladder is extremely stable when in the A-frame configuration regardless of height.  The same can be said for the stair setup.  When used as a straight extension ladder I did notice some bowing at full and near full extension.  This can be slightly frightening when working in a near vertical position with a tub of paint in one hand but is still workable.  Even at full extension working on a 17 foot ceiling beam the 22-foot ladder had very little rattle or shake.  The widened legs at both ends made for a much more stable base that makes the ladder practically impossible to knock over (I tried) and feels much more stable than straight leg ladders that I have used in the past.  I will note that the ladder is pretty heavy and cannot be easily put into position at full or near extension with a single person comfortably.  Still it is lighter than a comparable fiberglass ladder and the stability is a no-contest winner.  When folded it packs away easily against a wall and stands freely without tipping although I do not recommend leaving it that way for long.  I put my highest recommendation on this ladder for anyone looking for a top quality multifunction ladder.,N,N,,,
B0000VYDHA,If this ladder is IA rated 300 lb and my own weight is (for example) 310 lb does it mean I cannot use this ladder? Thank you!,The Werner MT-13 300-pound duty rated telescoping multi-ladder can be an inside ladder two people can simutaniously use each side together to get a tough job done or outside as a ladder that can reach the roof. This ladder can be used as a scaffold and as a step ladder also. There are so many uses that it would take me forever to list them all on here but you can believe me when I say that Werner is one of the most trusted companies in the business and it does everything the little giant does for a fraction of the price I purchased mine here on amazon since I get the free shipping with the prime club which is the only way to go. The only hard part is when you change it to the extension ladder the trick is to do it on the driveway or somewhere flat and make each extension until it is fully extended and pick it up from one end then move towards the middle if you are doing it by yourself and it will be easier to place. Get the longer verions if you have a two story or if you will be using it to get to higher places that 10-11 feet. I have a one story so this is perfect for everything I need it for.,N,N,,,
B0000VYDHA,If this ladder is IA rated 300 lb and my own weight is (for example) 310 lb does it mean I cannot use this ladder? Thank you!,I bought this MT-13 because of its versatility - I thought it would be the right size for a variety of jobs on a one story house.  What I hadn't been expecting was the weight of the thing - when its together it's like carrying around two ladders at once.  I guess that's part of the tradeoff for a 300 lb rated ladder but unless you're a NFL lineman by day you may want to think twice before getting this thing for odd-job use.I didn't take the ladder back because I do appreciate its quality and versatility but I do keep it apart as two three-step ladders which are quite handy.  It's a snap to assemble and adjust when a taller ladder is needed and I will say I feel more secure on this than on my old wooden stepladders.  Also good for scaffolding.,N,N,,,

B000O8OTNC,Will this product sharpen scissors?,My take on this product is. Well I wouldnt sharpen by BenchMade Knifes with this product. As it will only shape the very top edge of a convex blade.

B000O8OTNC,Will this product sharpen scissors?,The first sharpener I got which was more expensive than this one I not only wanted to sharpen knives but also my scissors. After I tried it on my scissors it nearly ruined them. I later learned that you can't use the really basic model for sharpening scissors. The Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal has not disappointed at all. I was able to use the tapered diamond rod to sharpen 3 pairs of scissors! I'm glad I didn't throw them away because they now cut just like new! I really like the fact that the carbide slot and the ceramic slot have a little label next to the slots so someone like me doesn't use the wrong side. This is lightweight pocket size and a very handy tool to sharpen almost anything you need to sharpen. I'm going to use this next to sharpen my wood saw. I'd buy this product again in a heartbeat!,N,Y,,,

B00002N6SG,Does the serial number have a D in the front of it?,"This is a top quality rugged and bright flashlight with bulk. This bulk can be an asset or drawback depending on your needs.Pros:a) Very ruggedly made with aluminum construction.  This light can be dropped in mud rocks and water without destroying it.  The only drawback is that the regular bulb can break rendering your light useless.  However I have never had a bulb break.  If breaking is a concern Maglite makes an LED version which cannot break.b) This light is very bright.c) The on/off switch is on the side near the front. It is rubber shielded to eliminate water and dirt getting into the light.  It is not easy to accidentally turn it on but is easy to find in the dark by feel.d) The light takes 3 D cells easy to find and last a long time.e) Police have routinely used these Maglites as a combination baton and light.  While thank goodness I've never had to use as a baton it might add to a more secure feeling in certain situations.f) The light is a good ""thrower"".  That is it projects a tight beam a long distance without dispersing much.  There might be a better throwing light available but it will undoubtedly cost much more.g) The light can be focused.  It can throw a tight beam or spread the light out more to the sides; very adaptable.Cons:a) The light can be heavy if carried for long periods on your belt or in your coat pocket etc.b) The light is large and bulky to carry.  This could also be an advantage so it depends on your needs.Conclusion:All in all this is a high quality light.  It has few substitutes if you are looking for a bright and rugged light with some bulk.  If you want a bright light in a smaller package the Maglite XL50 might be a good option:MAGLITE XL50-S3016 LED Flashlight Black",Y,N,,,
B00002N6SG,Does the serial number have a D in the front of it?,"This is really a bright flashlight.  A classic Maglite product.  Made from aircraft aluminum.  It is really rugged that it became an issue with the LAPD for using them as a melee weapon.  Wife does not want to touch it it is heavy like a sledgehammer.Pros:-It is blinding bright.-Adjustable beam spread by twisting the head which is also serves as the on and off switch.-Well constructed in every detail.-Water resistant-It even includes a spare lamp inside the tail cap (under the spring).-Reasonable priceCons:-Uses 4 ""D"" batteries that makes it so heavy and big.  It is a struggle to carry it unless you need it also as a weapon.-Maglites are somewhat overrated in my opinion.",Y,N,,,
B00002N6SG,Does the serial number have a D in the front of it?,It reminds me of that Croc Dundee movie bring this flashlight out and people will take notice. The light output is the same as my other mag lights I was thinking about going to the LED attachment but it is bright enough for what I need. But it is heavy either a two handed club or you need to be strong for one handed use.I have it mounted on the floor in clips just in front of the drivers seat in my pick-up barely fits. Got the clips on Amazon too.I was  a little worried that this might be illegal to carry in a vehicle so I asked a Policeman he said it was OK. I would hate to use this as a club against someone but whatever part of someone you hit its going to leave a mark and break something.,Y,N,,,
B00002N6SG,Does the serial number have a D in the front of it?,"I've had one of these rolling around under the back seat storage area of my Dodge Off Road Edition 4X4 for the past 5 years and it works great. I think I might have changed the batteries in it once or twice and it gets used pretty often. I also use a large Spot light for spotting things in the dark while driving off road. But This 3 D cell flashlight works great when we get out of the truck at night or or when setting up a camp or walking down a trail. Some of the ""roads"" I've driven would have taken out an average flashlight and though the paint has been scraped off here and there it still works great.At home we have one near the front door and if we hear something outside this thing has enough power to spot anything you point it at.I know everyone is into LED now but as I've said I this thing is well built and puts out enough light to do the job.",Y,N,,,
B00002N6SG,Does the serial number have a D in the front of it?,Bought this for my in-laws. I've had the same light for over 15 years. I did go and purchase seperately the LED bulb for it though. It does help with the battery consumption. I highly recommend this upgrade.,Y,N,,,
B00002N6SG,Does the serial number have a D in the front of it?,I have had mine for years and it has never let me down. It does not use up batteries as fast as other flashlights too.  It has a very solid body so it doubles as a defensive weapon. I have one in my car and one at home.  I also have 2 4D cell LED Maglites for times when I need to walk around the neighborhood.,Y,N,,,
B00002N6SG,Does the serial number have a D in the front of it?,Hay YO what can we say bout it? I will not mind driving over U'R Flashy lite Just do not want to drive a truck over mine OK!!I did get the 6 D cell one so I can put the spinner handle on it and look k@@l.  Actually U have the light on my black rifle and that makes a  great front handle for the front end of the stock. Still works on the front of mine so that is where you do dit da da. The 6 cell one is a wee bit heavy still I do like it that way.I got it to add the LED light to it and boy is it the only way to flySo super man up up and away it is the brightest thing with out wheels. Plus shiny black I should have called it a Cadillac.dray,Y,N,,,

B000NQ4PBG,Do these adapters come with a case?,This is a set of nice black finish (not black chrome) adapters. I find these convinient when working with U-joints with a small electric impact (to put lugs on while the car is in the air dont forget to tighten with a torque wrench!) and just generally useful for low torque applications. I feel like these will last.,N,N,,,

B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,Fast way to disconnect and reconnect things from the Dremel Tool.Allows you to connect more accessories quickly and securely.It was shipped quickly and got to me early.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,From my experience this should be built into any rotary tool design. This fit on my Black & Decker RTX-B without issue.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,This little add-on tool is excellent.It allows you to quickly switch from one attachment to another.It holds on even when you are cutting iron/steel(note read manual on this and be careful.),Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,i do not know why dremel just does not supply this with its tools automatically...  this is one great idea and works like a charm,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,Works well. Very happy with it. Does what I need doing. Very very useful. Thank you for it. Good show.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,Good tool for what it does. Much quicker and easier then the standard chuck. If you change tools on your Dremel... this is a must have.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,Simple and easy to use.  Lets you change bits withoutany tools.  Does not let you use any bits larger than thestandard Dremel Chuck does don't let the picture misleadyou.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,Like everyone says this makes switching out bits so much easier. I don't know why I waited so long to get this. I don't see any downsides to it except that it doesn't fit the largest bits but I've never needed to use anything with my Dremel 4000 that this couldn't fit. This should come standard with every Dremel in my opinion. I guess having all these separate accessories is just Dremel's way of making a buck but whatever. It's a good product so I don't mind supporting them.,Y,Y,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,this Accessory is a great help when you need change repeatly your bits I improve the model (Dremel 400-6/90 400 Series XPR Variable Speed Rotary Tool) with this one,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,It didn't say it would work for the 4000 Dremel (But it does!).I got it just to try it out but realized I had to have it for my 4000 because I'm using small diamond bits which wouldn't work without it.Read some other comments that said it wouldn't hold their tools.  Not had that issue.  I love it.,Y,Y,,,
B004BOAUQU,Can this light be mounted on to an AR15 with a standard weaver/picatinny rail?,great flashlight for the car. it is very bright and the magnetic back makes it ideal for working under the car.,Y,N,,,
B004BOAUQU,Can this light be mounted on to an AR15 with a standard weaver/picatinny rail?,Great little flashlight especially for the price! Quality materials and I love the magnetic end! Excellent customer service at Nebo also.,Y,N,,,
B004BOAUQU,Can this light be mounted on to an AR15 with a standard weaver/picatinny rail?,the light was bright enough but doesnt look like 220 lumens. after using it for 2 weeks the lens snapped off at the red adaptor. too bad for me,Y,N,,,
B004BOAUQU,Can this light be mounted on to an AR15 with a standard weaver/picatinny rail?,All I can say is; awesome.  This light is super bright.  The five modes are ok.  I don't really need the sos or strobe but I guess the strobe could blind a would be attacker.  It takes 3 AAA which are cheap and available.  I wish it didn't have a red ring on it but it isn't all that lighted I suppose that is for the emergency sos mode.  I love it because you have 3 regular light modes to choose from to conserve power.  Shining it on a light surface up close on high mode is almost too bright sometimes and has to be changed to a lower mode.  This light is really bright.  It's well constructed.  Batteries seem to last long enough considering the high output.  I just love the new led technology.  Unless you get a defective flashlight which happens sometimes you will get your money's worth from this light.  Yeah; there might be better flashlights but not for the money.  This thing is fairly affordable and really very bright.  I'm sure some people will find faults with this light but not me.  It's just a good deal in my book.  Oh the Nebo SE is out and on it's way to my house.  I'm looking forward to getting it.  But this old Nebo will always be a keeper.  A person can never have too many flashlights.  Strength in numbers.  Just buy it or spend a little more and get the new Nebo SE here at Amazon.,Y,N,,,
B004BOAUQU,Can this light be mounted on to an AR15 with a standard weaver/picatinny rail?,This is a great flashlight. it is very bright. Very compact. It has a magnet on the bottom. It has multiple modes that you can select by pressing the button multiple times.,Y,N,,,
B004BOAUQU,Can this light be mounted on to an AR15 with a standard weaver/picatinny rail?,It's bright as can be. Or you can click the brightness down as desired. Magnetic back ring is a nice touch for mounting it on any flat steel surface.First one is over two years old. They will eat up the batteries at full brightness but still a really nice tool.,Y,N,,,
B004BOAUQU,Can this light be mounted on to an AR15 with a standard weaver/picatinny rail?,There are things about this light that you won't like once it arrives but I doubt you'll send it back. Honestly for the quality of the light you get out of this thing for $21 and some change you have to give it five stars even if you can find all these faults because the light is that good coming out of the end of it and as far as infinite adjustment of the beam well I have not found anything that allows this much control outside a mag lite and you won't find it quite this nice in one of those.Now as for those small but annoying things!1)This light had so many sharp burs all around lens assembly when it arrived that I had to take a hand held diamond fish hook sharpener to it to trim them down. These burrs would certainly cut with enough pressure applied and maybe that is what it was left on there for but for the record I don't like it so I removed the sharp edges and those burrs formed from the machining of the grooving in the self defense apparatus of this light.2) You have to fumble through all the other settings to get to the one you want. It sucks but its not so bad other than perhaps undue wear on the switch.3) The light is big. Its a little giant really as its bigger around and longer than I imagined in pictures. Its not bad don't get me wrong still much smaller than a large Mag Lite and way more light out of it but it is not a pocket light in my opinion. This is more akin to a duty light as opposed to a EDC.4) The button is an index finger only on off button. I can't even make it come on with my thumb.5) This is a big light with no lanyard no pocket clip and no carry case. Its not really even set up with any way of hooking it up to a lanyard which to me is a bit odd.Now for the good.The light is bright white. Judging the light based on just solely what comes out the end of it you can't argue and it will stand up to the best lights I've played with. On high it is a very impressive beam of light and on flood it will astound you at the truly impressive display of steady light to really bring a place to life. I love the adjustable beam feature this light brings to the table with the twist adjustment like my Maglites offer. That is like the mag lite only the light is much more impressive from this Nebo than any MagLite I have ever used. I can light the entire back yard with the Redline and although the BA20 by Jet Beam is brighter this light is slightly whiter so its a toss up as to which you might like. I favor the BA20 for size and ease of use but its priced higher so for the money this is a better buy and just as much light albeit in a different package.The magnet on the end is an interesting feature with this light. It sticks no problem to the fridge and it may be that for some jobs like working under the hood of the old truck or maybe underneath a crawl space when working on duct work this will be handy. I do like that it stands flat on its end and I like that it has a self defense purpose but honestly I really have trouble believing anyone could EDC (everyday carry) this light. Its too big!Lastly the light is machined well and I do like the design as well as the easy instructions for functions printed right on the light. The parts fit well it appears well done with top materials to me. I can't say I'm really a fan of the red stripe on this light but my wife thought it was cute.The button does glow in the dark and that is nice but I must say of all the lights I've played with lately this one has a button that is less worthy of praise than even some of the very cheap plastic lights you can buy. It seems to me the light was well thought out and then someone stopped after only going so far with the design.With a little more work like adding either a pocket clip or a lanyard ring option on the light or at carry pouch to make carry on a belt easier I think the light would be much more complete.,Y,N,,,
B004BOAUQU,Can this light be mounted on to an AR15 with a standard weaver/picatinny rail?,This is hands down the brightest and most rigid flashlight for the price.  I own four of these things and will probably buy a couple more.  One stays in the glove box of each vehicle in my BOB and near my desk for when the power goes out.  At 220 lumen the light is very impressive but can tear through the AAA batteries.  However on the lowest level there is still plenty of light and it has an excellent battery life span.  You can focus the light to be a sharp beam or you can expand it to light up an entire wall from about 10 feet away with no dead spot in the middle.  For the price I think the people that aren't happy simply expected too much but everybody should have at least one or two of these things.  I've dropped them on pavement multiple times without failure.  My main complaint is that the red ring around the head of it lights up while turned on which might look cool but can be annoying.. especially if you are holding it in your teeth or something while using both hands.  The S.O.S feature is pretty cool and the strobe feature makes it great for tactical purposes... very disorienting.  All in all buy this thing!,Y,N,,,
B004BOAUQU,Can this light be mounted on to an AR15 with a standard weaver/picatinny rail?,"While learning the settings took a while this flashight is a great find. Had a rechargeable high lumen flashlight that was twice the price. The wires to the battery pack did not hold up the unit became impossible to charge and it had to be scrapped. This replaceable battery model does all the expensive rechargeable did and more with standard batteries. The only ""con"" is that the on/off switch in the rear is a bit hard to engage with the thumb or one finger while holding it with the same hand. It takes two hands to cut the unit on and off. Changing its functions is easy as each is totally touch sensitive.",Y,N,,,
B004BOAUQU,Can this light be mounted on to an AR15 with a standard weaver/picatinny rail?,LED lights work great in general and spare the batteries.  However if you plan to clamp this to a gun rail be VERY careful with the force you use.  The internal battery holder is a cheap plastic and will easily crack and crumble if slightly deformed. This is the biggest weakness in the longevity of this product.,Y,N,,,

B003IT5F14,Does this work 4 unique blades? Kukri Karambit etc. I want 2 get this but it doesn't help overall if it can't put razor's edge on my Karambits etc,works as described.  sharpened all our knives in no time.  they are all razor sharp now. i even shaved myarm hair with them.  i would reccommend them.,Y,N,,,
B003IT5F14,Does this work 4 unique blades? Kukri Karambit etc. I want 2 get this but it doesn't help overall if it can't put razor's edge on my Karambits etc,This tool does exactly what it says. It sharpens knives to a very sharp edge.when I first started sharepening my own knoves and tools I used a Lansky. It did a good job but took a bit of time to master. I then started sharpening free hand using multiple stones. This gave me excellent results but tool a lot of time and concentration to maintain the correct angle. Due to some physical issues I can no longer sharpen knives by hand.When I purchased this I expected it to produce a decent edge but not of the quality that I was getting by hand. I was concerned about the big leaps in grit fineness between the belts. I am happy to report that this is a non-issue. This sharpener does an excellent job in a very short time without removing a lot of steel from your knives. The edge is exceptionally sharp.It doesn't matter whether it is a kitched knife outdoor/defensive knife or scissors. All were very sharp. I have not used it as a grinder or on lawn mower blades. No doubt it will perform the same. It is very easy to use. The guides maintain the proper angle.I have no reservation in recommending this item. I wish I had purchased it a few years ago. It would have saved me a lot of time. There is a new model coming scheduled in Fall 2013 but it is my understanding that this item will be continued.,Y,N,,,
B003IT5F14,Does this work 4 unique blades? Kukri Karambit etc. I want 2 get this but it doesn't help overall if it can't put razor's edge on my Karambits etc,"Truly remarkable sharpener it put a razor sharp edge on all my hunting knives in a matter of minutes.  Initially I avoided knives with a convex edge but now thats all I want.  This sharpener is well built & easy to operate.  I was truly stunned at how quickly and efficiently it put a wicked edge on every knife I put through it.My tired battered 32 year old Marine Corps Ka-Bar got put in the gunsafe several years ago because I couldn't get it to take an edge anymore.  It has great sentimental value to me so I was hesitant to run it through a power sharpener but after seeing how easy and efficient it was a decided to give it a try.  In less than 5 minutes it was re-born with a gleaming edge that cut through thin paper like warm butter.  Amazing!!This is the best money I've spent in a long time.  I'm done with manual ""sharpening systems"" stones and rods.  If you're serious about keeping your knives sharp get one of these you won't be sorry.  I can't recommend it highly enough..",Y,N,,,
B003IT5F14,Does this work 4 unique blades? Kukri Karambit etc. I want 2 get this but it doesn't help overall if it can't put razor's edge on my Karambits etc,sharpened about 5 knifes in the first week.  I consider my self a fair knife sharpener using standard flat stones but am unable to sharpen newer harder stainless blades.  love the harder steels these days no rust and holds edge but sending off for sharpening was silly.  this works on those blades.  I had several older cheap stainless blades I just couldn't edge any more that had been relegated to bait cutting knifes.  there back into my daily carry rotation now with edges that will just shave hair.  not super sharp/new factory edge sharp but plenty sharp for most purposes.  sharpening process with this contraption is pretty strait forward and easy to figure out.  from reading on line it appears there are tricks you pick up over time that help make the edge sharper.  maybe with the tool or an outside tool like a stromp steel ceramic etc.,Y,N,,,
B003IT5F14,Does this work 4 unique blades? Kukri Karambit etc. I want 2 get this but it doesn't help overall if it can't put razor's edge on my Karambits etc,I read the reviews watched the videos and decided to pull the trigger with dreams of cutting down on my knife sharpening time significantly.  I started out with some of my cheaper knives as suggested knowing how easy it is to round off the tip of a knife.  And they weren't kidding!!!  My first attempt promptly left me with a blunt tip knife.  Not i big deal though it was a really cheap knife.  So I watched some more vids and read in some forums on how to prevent rounding the tip.  This worked but I was left with a knife that just wasn't that sharp.  Even the portions of the blade that are flat just don't get that sharp.  I tried 5 different knives of varying quality still and got similar results with all.  Maybe I have higher expectations for my blades but this tool just can't touch the razor sharp blades that using Arkansas or Japanese water stones provide so this tool has been regulated to sharpening mower blades unless I decide to try to sell this to some unsuspecting fool locally.I think this would be a little more useful if the speed of the belt could be variable as it is the belt removes steel so fast you can't take your time making sure the keep the blade at the right angle or trying to not round the tip.Bottom line if you care about your expensive EDC hunting or kitchen knives and need a sharp blade and tip STAY AWAY from the Work Sharp sharpener.  But if you have never used quality blades with a good edge and don't know any better this might work for you.EDIT - 3-07-14For all the negative comments I'm getting I don't think any of you have actually sharpened a knife with an Arkansas stone or Japanese water stones or you just don't know how to use these correclty.  The Work Sharp will sharpen my knives to slice through newspaper but it's still ever so slightly grabby not quit to the level of the smooth slice when I hand sharpen.  While I won't let this touch my nice Benchmade or SOG pocket knives I've been using this for my cheaper Victorinox kitchen knives and the edge doesn't hold as long as sharpening with a stone either.  You also have to be extremely careful with the tip one small wrong move and your sharp knife point is gone and you're left with a rounded tip.I'll restate my verdict: If you want something to very quickly get your knives pretty sharp then yes this tool will do that.  But if you payed good money for knives with good steel and want true razor blade sharpness and don't mind spending the time with a stone getting that then the Work Sharp tool is a short cut to only achieve 85% of that.  It'll get close but the edge isn't quite as good won't last quite as long and it's not worth the risk of rounding the tip of a $40-90 pocket knife your favorite hunting knife or a quality forged steel kitchen knife.  If you payed good money for knives that will last generations then give them the time they deserve to get them super sharp.  Cheap stamped kitchen knives on the other hand...who cares do what you want!,Y,N,,,
B003IT5F14,Does this work 4 unique blades? Kukri Karambit etc. I want 2 get this but it doesn't help overall if it can't put razor's edge on my Karambits etc,Be sure to read the instructions before using this item. It works very well and with a bit of practice you can sharpen darn near anything. Our kitchen knives have never been sharper. Can't want to try it on my mower blades this spring!,Y,N,,,
B003IT5F14,Does this work 4 unique blades? Kukri Karambit etc. I want 2 get this but it doesn't help overall if it can't put razor's edge on my Karambits etc,Great product.

B003IT5F14,Does this work 4 unique blades? Kukri Karambit etc. I want 2 get this but it doesn't help overall if it can't put razor's edge on my Karambits etc,This product is GREAT.It will sharpen just about anything. And in fact WILL sharpen anything you can get the belts on to. If one takes their time and practices with this tool you can sharpen any knife to a glassy edge that will cut with just its own weight to push the balde through many obejects. Don't Cut yourself..cause this product will indeed put a Great edge on any knife. YOU have to pay close attention to the angle your guide is and be very patient and do not rush your blade through.This product will sharpen any knife and any tool you can get the belts onto.Even lawn mower blades and shovels pickspost hole diggers etc etc etc.....But with fine knives such as carving knives one must have patience and watch the guide you use and this tool will put a mirrors edge on the blades if you do it right and carefully and with practice and patience......any specia;lty knife can be sharpened even those dread sharadded knives everyone complains cant be sharpened this will sharpen them to if you do it right and with care and patience...thats the KEY  do Not rush any sharpening on any blade.Free hand on a mower blade or shovel etc etc... sure go as fast as you like but on those specialty blades...Do Not Rush perfection.This product gets hot and also can burn you with non-stop use....so use it wisely and it will do the job perfectly .,Y,Y,,,

B00C1CF1S6,Will this work on a craftsman opener than was purchased in 07 - belt drive w/ battery backup. I believe chamberlain makes all of the craftsman openers,Hello thereThe reason I give this product 4 stars is because the software needs works but that been said I have to tell you I do like the concept and indeed the product itself.To install it you need to replace the actual controller now you can monitor you door from the web and even control but it has some challenges when configuring the network if you are doing NAT/PAT with an internet sharing router. There you have to do port mapping and that's sometimes hard depending on your ISP.That said this is a good concept but the easy of installation and the software stability needs to be improved by some margin. Even when not ready I really recommend it and think is worth the price.Hope this helps.JP,Y,N,,,
B00C1CF1S6,Will this work on a craftsman opener than was purchased in 07 - belt drive w/ battery backup. I believe chamberlain makes all of the craftsman openers,Great combo kit to add remote control your garage door from an iPhone app.  If you are like me and can't always remember if you closed the door that particular day this is a great tool.  The app tells you how long the door has been in its current state and with a simple click can open or close.  I have mine setup to send a text after 30 minutes of being open which actually happened for the first time this past weekend.  I just opened the app and closed the door easy as it gets.Note that I did not have to re-learn and of the home link devices from my cars.  Just swapped out and followed the instructions to connect to the internet base.  Up and running within 20 minutes.,Y,N,,,
B00C1CF1S6,Will this work on a craftsman opener than was purchased in 07 - belt drive w/ battery backup. I believe chamberlain makes all of the craftsman openers,NOTE ON INTERNET/SMARTPHONE ACCESS ACCOUNT: The account for internet and smartphone access is FREE FOR LIFE. I just contacted Chamberlain and they confirmed that there will never be a charge for accessing the unit via the internet or smart phone.INSTALLATION:Installation only takes a few steps and shouldn't give anyone any real issues. I did have a small problem when I installed the unit so I will cover that issue and tell you how I fixed it.I installed the opener button and the internet connectivity kit as stated in the instructions then I tried to set up my account on mychamberlain.com. The account setup was easy enough; all you do is enter your personal information and the serial number from the back of the internet connectivity kit. I then tried to add the garage door opener to the account multiple times only to get an error saying that I should try again later. In looking at the opener button I noticed that the LEDs were not completely solid and were kind of pulsating. I removed the opener disconnected the red wire and then reconnected it. The lights on the unit turned solid and I was immediately able to set it up via the website. Please keep this in mind if you have any issues with the install; you might just need to remove power from the opener button and reconnect.FUNCTIONALITY:As far as the functionality of the opener button goes I cannot complain. You press the button and the door goes up or down as it should. Now comes the BEST part about this unit. You can set a timer for 1 5 or 10 minutes so that the garage door will automatically close without your intervention. This will make it so that you will never accidentally leave your garage door open again. The only issue I have with this is that there is a loud beep that goes off when the garage door is automatically closing. There is apparently no way to turn the beeping sound off so you will have a loud beep when the door closes on its own.PHONE/INTERNET CONTROL:You can control the unit from your smartphone (ANDROID or iPHONE) allowing you to make sure that the door is able to be opened or closed if your battery runs down in your remote. The application on the phone as well as the internet page shows you the status of your garage door so you will know if it is up or down. All you do is touch the garage door icon on your phone or click the box on your computer to open or close the door.The phone application seems a bit flaky and I have reduced the review to four stars based upon the performance of the application. I cannot get the application to stay connected without having to re-enter my password repeatedly. The phone application is not good so this might be a bit of a problem. I am contacting Chamberlain to see what they have to say about the issue and I will update the review accordingly.EDIT: I spoke to a representative from Chamberlain and was told that the application was being updated and that it should be released on May 1st.  The representative said that the update would make the application function as it should and that it should no longer suffer from the problems that I have been experiencing.  I have tested the application on my phone today and have had no issues.  This does not mean that the problems are resolved however... it simply means that I am not having issues right now.  Only time will tell if the problems have been ironed out.EDIT #2: The phone application is now back to the flaky operation from yesterday.  I do not believe that they have fixed anything with it at this point as it is failing constantly.BOTTOM LINE: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,Y,Y,,,
B00C1CF1S6,Will this work on a craftsman opener than was purchased in 07 - belt drive w/ battery backup. I believe chamberlain makes all of the craftsman openers,We had ourChamberlain WD962KEV Whisper Drive Garage Door Opener with MyQ Technology and Battery Backupinstalled about a year we have been absolutely thrilled with it's many great features. Now that we have installed a Z-Wave network throughout our home we've come to appreciate the home automation control from our smartphone.  As of writing this we have not found a suitable means for adding ANY garage door opener to our ZWave network (we are using a Mi Case Verde Lite controller.)  This is a great interim option until we find a ZWave enabled option to add to our Chamberlain garage door.PLEASE NOTE - this model is for those Chamberlain garage door openers that are NOT MyQ enabled.  If your newer Chamberlain garage door opener has the MyQ logo then save yourself some dough and order theChamberlain CIGBU MYQ Internet Gatewaymodel instead. The ONLY difference between these two models is the CIGCWC model includes a wall mounted remote control to replace the existing wall controller.  This replacement wall mount controller is NOT compatible with the newest Chamberlain garage door openers with MyQ and is absolutely not needed. The CIGBU model omits the extra controller saving you a few dollars. If you ordered the wrong kit by mistake no worries the Internet Gateway is the same in both kits just discard the extra wall remote control once everything is operational (or gift it to someone on the ReuseIt Network.)FREE means FREE - there is NO monthly fees.  Yes you must activate an account but NO it does not require a credit card and NO it does not have any billing.  Ours has been installed over a month with absolutely no issues whatsoever.,Y,Y,,,
B00C1CF1S6,Will this work on a craftsman opener than was purchased in 07 - belt drive w/ battery backup. I believe chamberlain makes all of the craftsman openers,Unfortunately I missed the line about this only working with the Chamberlain Garage door openers newer than 1998.  Replacing the old opener soon and then I can update this review.  Love the idea of controlling from an app and no longer worrying about security of the old type door openers.,Y,Y,,,
B00C1CF1S6,Will this work on a craftsman opener than was purchased in 07 - belt drive w/ battery backup. I believe chamberlain makes all of the craftsman openers,When I bought my current garage door opener it had a feature called MyQ.  I had no idea what that meant but I bought it anyway.  A couple of years later I bought acar with MyQ button in the control panel and quickly learned I could program one to open my garage door.  Woohoo no more remote stuck to the sun visor!When this product was introduced I went through a similar period of head scratching.  Would it work with my door opener?  What would it do?  How well would it do it?  Would I need an electrician to install it? Here's what I learned:COMPATIBILITY:  the product literature stresses that it is made only for Chamberlain door openers.  That's a little misleading because Chamberlain is the company behind several brand names.  My door opener is actually a Sears Craftsman and it works 100% as it should.  Chamberlain also makes Liftmaster and while I didn't test it with a Liftmaster the fact that there is a virtually identical app seems to verify that it is the same.EASE OF INSTALLATION:  much easier than expected total time less than 15 minutes including downloading apps and programming. Here's the sequence ... open package; replace old indoor switch with new one (2 wires. Screws into same holes); wait a minute for the new switch to get comfortable; push button to test opening the door (all of your remote settings are kept no reprogramming necessary); plug gateway box into your router and wait a few seconds for it to get comfortable; go to your computer and register online; download the iPhone or Android app and match it to your system; done.FEATURES: at this time the features are basic but as part of the MyQ system there is a lot of opportunity for expansion. The system comes with an inside-garage replacement control panel that is more sophisticated than the original (can be set to automatically close the door at varying intervals has overrides for lights and vacation settings has a motion sensor to turn lights on). There is a small gateway device that plugs in to your internet router and a downloadable app for both desktop computers and smartphones. You can raise and lower the door from your smartphone and have alerts sent to you if the door is opened without your permission. The capability exists to tie in to other MyQ devices to let you do the same with lights or intrusion alert systems. As a personal preference I liked my original opener control panel better. It was bright red with a large ribbed button and featured a lighted LCD clock/thermometer. This control panel is not ruggedized and lacks the LCD panel. While there is a tiny dim LED to help find the activator button it is harder to find. Suggestion to the manufacturer edge light the entire activator pad.MORE: the only area of concern for something like this is the registration process. If you answer every question (you are not required to do so) you would be matching your name and address in a system that could be hacked and conceivably someone could track where you live. Contrary to what some have stated your address is OPTIONAL. Fortunately the only piece of information that is critical is that your zip code be in the time zone in which you live and of course your email address though you can opt out of being contacted. You can even make up a bogus name for yourself.DO YOU NEED IT: as a gadget it's not ridiculously expensive but it doesn't seem to be a necessity for most people. In fact there is a tiny concern you might accidentally push the wrong button and accidentally open your garage door when you are 1000 miles away. To safeguard against that you can enter a double layer of password protection against opening a door lock without entering the password a second time. The value of the gadget increases if you have a house/cabin in a remote area where you don't live full-time. It's,Y,Y,,,
B00C1CF1S6,Will this work on a craftsman opener than was purchased in 07 - belt drive w/ battery backup. I believe chamberlain makes all of the craftsman openers,"I made the extremely silly mistake of passing 50 a couple of years ago. This cost me some memory capacity as evidenced by the number of times I leave the house then turn around and go back to make sure I closed the garage door. Enter this brilliant little gizmo from Chamberlain.Our garage door opener is a 2008 modelChamberlain WD822KD Whisper Drive 1/2-HP Belt Drive Garage Door Opener. Installation of the Internet/Smartphone connectivity kit took about 15 minutes by following the included instructions. First you replace your existing door control in the garage. In our case we could use the same screws in the same screw holes without cutting the wires-nicely done. Next you plug the CIGBU internet gateway into your wireless router. The instructions say that this will work with a wireless ethernet adapter if you do not have ethernet ports available but this was not necessary in our case.Next you download an app to your smartphone. We use the app on iPhone 5 and iPad 2 and did not test the Android app. Create an account click a button or two and you will be able to open and close your garage door from your iPhone. More importantly you can check to see it's current status (mine says ""Closed for 9 minutes"" right now).Chamberlain thought through the security issues: If your iPhone turns off while you are in the app you must log back in when you wake up the phone to use the app. Otherwise unauthorized people might be able to open your garage door when you aren't looking. Also the new door control allows you to set a timer to close your door automatically. I tried this option then realized it was unnecessary in our case. Consider using it if you are super forgetful.We are extremely happy with this product. Well done Chamberlain!Update after 6 weeks: Yea the memory isn't what it used to be. I use this 2-3 times a week sometimes two minutes after leaving the house. It works great.",Y,Y,,,
B00C1CF1S6,Will this work on a craftsman opener than was purchased in 07 - belt drive w/ battery backup. I believe chamberlain makes all of the craftsman openers,This was a great purchase. I have it in my craftsman opener and it works great at a lower price. It installed in under 10 minutes and with no PC needed. When you close the door from a phone it plays a series of beeps and blinks the lights before ge close to warn those around.  The status is great and the app pretty good. The new panel adds a lot of functions without the app. The bridge unit that allows for internet connection is WIRED not wireless.  This unit then connects wirelessly to the new panel in the garage. I had to move the gateway from a 10/100 switch to a 10/100/1000 switch but that may have been a fluke. I recommend. This to anyone who doesn't want to use the regular opener remotes. I would buy again!,Y,N,,,
B00C1CF1S6,Will this work on a craftsman opener than was purchased in 07 - belt drive w/ battery backup. I believe chamberlain makes all of the craftsman openers,"After replacing an old noisy chain drive opener I found aChamberlain Belt Drive Garage Door Openerto be much quieter. After my family moved to a new house I again changed out the old chain drive this time to a Chamberlain battery backup belt drive system. It has worked very well.When I selected this control I was really hoping to use it in parallel with the existing control. That way we could control the garage door from a side door. Unfortunately only one control can be used with the opener. The directions mention this but I tried it anyways. The opener does not seem to have enough power to drive both. The second panel backlight worked intermittently. I was able to wire another simple control (just a few buttons and an LED) and while it controlled the door the LED flickered. I decided it was not reliable and shelved the idea.Installing this control is very easy. Since the screw holes align with the old pattern it only takes a few minutes to exchange controls. Adding the internet gateway is also relatively straightforward. I did have to power cycle it in a few times before the indicator lights were in the correct state.The apps for Android and Apple work relatively well. I have noticed that the Android app requires logging in to the account each time before it will display status. Otherwise it just displays the ""Refreshing Device List"" screen. The push notifications are helpful but I ended up disabling them unless we are away from home for an extended period.Another new feature is the timer-to-close. This automatically closes the garage door after a specified period. It is a good feature that can be disabled.When I originally found out that only one wall control could be used I thought about just trying this one out and then reinstalling the original control panel; it has an LCD that shows the status as well as additional information such as time and temperature. But after using this for a while I decided to leave it. We have a clock that shows temperature nearby and the internet accessibility of this one makes it superior.",Y,N,,,

B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,Personally I think it's a bit on the price side but the real disappointment comes after repeated use.  Especially on uses where there is side loading or any chatter but chuck quickly loosens up.  There have been many applications where no matter how hard I tighten the chuck the bit comes loose after literally 10 seconds or less.  In these cases I have given up and used the collet.  I have two of these and the problem seems to get worse over time making the product proportionally more expensive due to its short lifespan.,Y,N,280,,

B0000302ZV,WILL THIS WORK WITH MODEL #280?,This small and inexpensive item is so versitile and makes your Dremel far more useful. After you use your Dremel with it you will wonder how you got by without it!It works just like any other keyless chuck on a larger drill it's all metal and holds tiny bits tightly and also holds the 1/8th inch bits well too. No wrench needed just give it a nice snugging by hand and it's good to go! It makes bit changing fast and easy and it also lets you put any size tiny drill bit into the Dremel with ease. All the way to zero no bit is too small. I have found that it takes a lot less effort to get it tight enough than I was used to it only takes a good snug twist to hold all bits well you don't have to use excessive force for it to hold. It also fits on the end of the flex shaft attachment or right angle attachment. It's such a time saver in bit changes you will quickly come to love it and wonder why the Dremel doesn't come with one in the first place! It will not fit in all accessories but for most of your Dremel work it's indespensible. I love mine! A must have item!,Y,N,280,,

B001DC9USC,does it fit with micro drill guide?,"Here is exactly what is in the box:NOTE:  The product description says the screws come ""in five sizes.""  That's a bit misleading; it sounds like you are getting five different lengths.  You are actually getting only THREE lengths (for three sizes of stock); two of the lengths come in both course and fine threads.  So you get five varieties but only three lengths.Course threads are for use in soft woods (pine - including hemlock MDF particleboard etc).  Fine threads are for hardwood (maple oak etc).For 3/4"" stock 1.25"" long screws bright finish:- 150# SML-F125 Maxi-Loc head #7 shank fine threads for 3/4"" hard stock- 150# SML-C125 Maxi-Loc head #8 shank course threads for 3/4"" soft stockFor 1/2"" stock 1"" long screws bright finish:- 150# SPS-F1 Pan Head #6 shank fine threads for 1/2"" hard stock- 150# SPS-C1 Pan Head #7 shank course threads for 1/2"" soft stockFor 1.5"" (""two-by"") stock 2.5"" long screws Blue-Kote finish:- 75# SML-C250B Maxi-Loc head #8 shank course threads for 1.5"" soft stockMaxi-Loc heads have a molded-in ""washer"" which increases the surface area of the head compared to the Pan Head variety.  All screws use the same size square-bit driver.""Bright"" finish means electroplate-galvanized zinc.  This finish won't stand up to long term exposure to adverse weather.  Blue-Kote finish (used only in the screws for 1.5"" stock) is weather resistant.  As the name suggests these screws are blue.The case is sturdy and should last for years and it REALLY adds a lot of value to the kit.  The locking tabs are nice and tight - if you drop the case it is unlikely to pop open and mix up your screws on the floor.  My only complaint is that the case does not have a provision to hold the square-drive bit.  A ""bit compartment"" would make it a little more useful (and an included bit even more so - an extra bit would be a nice bit of insurance).Kreg OEM screws are the highest quality.  You should always set your drill clutch to a reasonable torque (not much more than it needs to be for your stock) but you are unlikely to twist the head off of these screws or strip out the square socket if your clutch is too tight.I'll be buying a bunch more fine screws for 3/4"" hard stock which is my most common requirement.  The other screws I will need much less frequently but when you need an oddball screw it's a bummer to not have it.  The set makes no attempt to include screws for REALLY oddball stock sizes (how many people really use 1"" stock?)This is a good and generous assortment of high-quality screws for the most common stock sizes used in cabinet-style joinery.  An excellent value.(if you find my review helpful please ""like"" it. thanks!)",Y,N,micro,drill,guide

B001DC9USC,does it fit with micro drill guide?,I bought a Kreg Jig for one particular project. I've wound up using it for so many different things that I realized I needed to have an assortment of different screws handy when the need arises.The case is sturdier than the cases that have come with some of my power tools and latches securely so you don't have to run around picking screws up off the floor. Inside the lid is a guide that lets you know what screw to use when.I've tried using other screws for some pocket holes but they don't screw in as easily and it's hard to find pan head screws which provide better holding power in the pocket locally. I had to do that a couple of times when I wound up screwing pocket holes in material I wasn't planning on and didn't have the appropriate Kreg screws. It was for a temporary hold and it held up for the purpose but I use the Kreg Screws whenever I can.This should be the first Kreg accessory item you buy if you buy a Kreg pocket hole jig.,Y,N,micro,drill,guide

ENJOY!",N,N,water,proof,
B006VPPERC,Is this flash light water proof?,This flashlight is not as bright as two other 300 lumens flashlights that I currently own.  It's bright but not 300 lumen bright.  It's hard for me to really tell by comparing flashlights side by side on the exact lumens.  With that being said it's the brightest 1 AA battery flashlight that I own now.  I thought my 100 lumen lightstar 100 was bright for a 1 AA battery but this light is way brighter at least twice as bright.  My lightstar was twice the money but it is constructed better.  This light seems to be constructed ok but only time will tell.  This light is a good buy for the money.  If the flashlight holds up in the future I might buy the other rechargeable battery that this light can take people claim it will make it brighter; I'll report back on that someday.  Great buy not 300 lumen on  1 AA battery anyhow.  I'm still giving this light 5 stars because it's so small bright and really cheap.UPDATE: Aug. 28 2012:  Finally bought some 14500 batteries; I bought 2 with a charger I think I got some bad batteries because the light only burns for 20 minutes with them; has to be bad batteries.  Anyhow I just wanted to say WOW!; This little light has to be 300 lumens with these batteries so I guess they weren't lying when they said this light can reach 300 lumens.  Guess I'll buy me some more batteries of a different brand and hopefully get some good ones next time.  This light is truly amazing with the 14500 batteries blows my nebo's out of the water and I have the nebo SE also.  For this light's size with 14500 rechargeable battery I don't think there is a light on earth that is brighter at least not yet.

B006VPPERC,Is this flash light water proof?,I picked up 2 of these lights a year ago because I wanted to see what they were like and well I like flashlights. I have to say I am super impressed with these lights. I travel for work and love having this in my bag when I am out. I decided to write the review after taking one on vacation for 10 days in Puerto Rico. I took this out around the beach into the jungle and it worked great. I also took it kayaking at night in some lagoons and mangrove forests. This light was fully submerged accidentally in sea water twice and still works. Battery life is great too. They are small and are easy to pop in a pocket. I find myself grabbing one of these around the house more often than one of my more expensive surefire pelican or other lights.I cannot think of another flashlight I have seen with these features that could withstand falling into the ocean and still work for less than $3.00.,N,Y,water,proof,
B006VPPERC,Is this flash light water proof?,I indicate where I bought it as many reviewers here who say they've bought multiple of these flashlights always find them to be slightly different some real good some true junk with lots in between.I too have bought one from China over 2 weeks ago but I have little Idea when it will show up tracking is unavailable and the e mail declaring it had shipped never had any content.  As I bought the Ultrafire 14500 battery charger with 2 batteries I decided to spend the extra and buy this product from a USA shipper as well.  With Prime it arrived in 2 business days.So It arrived today and I threw a fully charged 3.7 volt(4.2 fully charged) 14500 battery in it and was very impressed with the light output.  This is as bright or brighter than an older 4 D cell maglite with a LED bulb in it.  In fact I think it is brighter at a 100 feet away. I'm lighting up trees in the neighbors yard 150 feet away and dogs start barking.My Flashlight says CREE on one side and Hausbell on the other.  It is semi gloss black with the orange button.  The Button is on/off only. No high low and strobe functions.Not obvious from photos or descriptions is that to focus the beam the business end of the flashlight extends about 11 mm.  Fully extended the beam is the narrowest where it projects the square beam/ reflection of the CREE bulb itself with 2 corners clipped.  Fully retracted is the wide beam and round.Fully concentrated/ fully extended the square beam on a white wall  8 feet away is about 6.5 inches in diameter and in a dark room hurts to look at at that distance.Fully retracted/ wide beam at the same distance is about 4 feet across and round.A 1.2 volt NiMh is still pretty bright but not the overwhelming hideously bright light that the 3.7 volt Li-ion battery produces.  Those that judge it with only a 1.2/1.5v AA battery in it will not be blown away with the light output.I don't really have any idea on battery life yet.The extender on mine is pretty tight no way will it move on its own.The lens unscrews from the extender part.  There is a rubber 0 ring but it is not tight. The threads seem a little sloppy. the unskilled could easily cross thread it. One can just barely feel when the O-ring is exerting pressure on the cap when re theading. Without the cap the light beam is much wider probably 12 feet wide at 8 foot of distance.  Much more diffuse light as expected.The cap on the back of it also has an o ring but appears flat in cross section and one can barely feel the resistance of the rubber 0 ring. Once again the threads are  kind of loose and crusty feeling and the novice or unskilled could easily cross thread it.  I'm sure a little silicone grease applied to the threads would go a long way on the smoothness and the water resistance factor.The screws for the clip on mine are tight.  The clip itself is very rigid and grabs tightly.  Actually kind of hard to attach.  With the back cap off one can see the ends of the screw inside.So I'd say this flashlight is water resistant not water proof.  It sounds as if some other reviewers got lights without O rings at all.  I could see a single well placed rain drop getting to the cree driver and ending it without O rings.It will be interesting to compare this USA shipped version to the one that is somewhere in transit from Asia to California for 1/3 the price with free shipping.,N,Y,water,proof,

B000SJO5QI,is the toilet seat itself flat (ie. not a dish-shaped contour) ? (bad back),"This is my second fancy toilet seat.  The seat and lid are made of pressed wood which is more more comfortable than plastic.  It is made by Bemis in Wisconsin (they even export them to Mexico!) and the label says that the wood is 100% recycled.  The quality is very good and the slow close feature really does work to prevent that ""clunking"" sound when the lid is dropped.Compared to a plain toilet seat the ring itself varies in width and is a little narrower in the front and back but overall it is wider with more overhang on the exterior and less overhang on the interior. It is much sturdier and more solid-feeling than a less expensive seat.The best feature is that the lid easily snaps off for cleaning but is quite secure when in use.  I never felt like the toilet was really clean around the hinge until I got a removable seat.  The toilet seat and lid are easily washed in the tub before cleaning it out.  This particular model has shell-shaped covers for the screws that are easy to undo.The paint is not a bright white but more of a bone white.  The DuraGuard finish incorporates silver ions to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and Bemis recommends the use of detergents for cleaning.I have been very happy with the better quality toilet seats and would not want to go back to using the less expensive ones.",Y,N,flat,contour,
B000SJO5QI,is the toilet seat itself flat (ie. not a dish-shaped contour) ? (bad back),Well as magic tricks go a self-lowering toilet seat isn't very exciting.  I also find it not especially helpful.  It's not a bad thing but after several decades of practice lowering toilet seats I don't feel in danger of slamming them or smashing my fingers or any other possible mini-tragedy.  But that's just me.  Maybe this feature would be useful for say a non-toilet-lid-closing eight-year old who finds the slooooow lowering of the lid entertaining.As toilet seats go though I like this one.  It looks pretty standard except that it does have a decorative groove around the top of the lid.  It also claims to be anti-microbial or anti-bacterial; I don't remember which and the product description doesn't mention that but the information was included with the toilet seat.  That's a plus.  I like that it is environmentally friendly.But what I like most what makes this better than any other toilet seat I've ever had is that by turning little locks on the hinges the whole thing can be lifted off.  I don't do this every time I clean but it is really nice to be able to do on occasion not have to use a little brush or just wipe alongside the hinges and hope for the best.The downside of these locks is that it makes the hinges a little large harder to clean around when the seat is not lifted off the toilet.I do wish that the hinges were metal instead of plastic.  The plastic looks nice everything white and clean-looking but I think metal is sturdier.  The seat is sturdy both for my average-sized tush and for hubby's greater weight. Overall 4.5 out of 5 stars.  The next time I need a toilet seat I'd most likely get one like this one again.,Y,N,flat,contour,
B000SJO5QI,is the toilet seat itself flat (ie. not a dish-shaped contour) ? (bad back),No more slamming toilet seat noises. My sons are much more likely to put the seat down.

B000SJO5QI,is the toilet seat itself flat (ie. not a dish-shaped contour) ? (bad back),My grandfather A.K.A. The Devil in the Frock Coat was expelled (well more literally thrown out a la Bum's Rush) from the old Moscow Military Academy for framing the portrait of Tsar Nicholas II with a toilet seat.  If he had only used a Mayfair things might have turned out differently.First of all these pop right off and back on the throne lickety split (okay poor choice of words).  But they do.  This means an easier and more thorough cleaning of both the seat and pedestal.  Which reminds me the instructions say to avoid abrasive cleaners and brushes in favor of wiping with a mild detergent.  I thought it bad form to ask if it is dishwasher safe.  It is made from wood which I like for temperature comfort and durability.Installation is a twist and a snap again literally.  The engineering is quite interesting on this beauty.  You center the seat easily and tighten the plastic nuts which are nice and long for that tricky reach around and under.  I went back and forth from one to the other to make sure it was pretty well centered.  When it is tight enough the lower nut actually twists off.  So you get optimal tightness with no guessing.  Plenty is left for later de-installation. I am impressed by the build quality and the clever engineering both.I moved plenty of reading material radio-TV a phone and a cup holder into the powder room.  Gonna be spending a lot more time on my throne.  And the styling makes it perfect for holding court.  I will get one for the guest room next mostly because I did not take the time on Amazon to make sure I matched the color.  Bone.  Who knew?  Guys do not know from color matching.  Although I might have gone for the bamboo. Anyway Mayfair is made in the USA so dump with pride.,Y,N,flat,contour,
B000SJO5QI,is the toilet seat itself flat (ie. not a dish-shaped contour) ? (bad back),Easy to install great for cleaning (seat pops right off to clean underneath well.)Only gripe is that the seat is too tight so it takes 3 minutes for it to lower itself down.

B000SJO5QI,is the toilet seat itself flat (ie. not a dish-shaped contour) ? (bad back),Mayfair seat replaced my old Kohler seat of about 7 years.  At first Mayfair was so foreign but soon I realized it's better much better - a dream!  Kohler seat was concave - its' hard to explain but when you try another one for a while - you understand how different they are.  Mayfair is flat and sure... very different from Kohler's plastic-y feel.Mayfair's best feature is slow close!  Both seat and lid lower slowly very slowly.  I love it.. thought it thoroughly perplexes my cats!!!,Y,Y,flat,contour,
B000SJO5QI,is the toilet seat itself flat (ie. not a dish-shaped contour) ? (bad back),The Mayfair Slow Close toilet seat with Lift-Off Hinges is a great product that makes cleaning the toilet bowl easier and eliminates banging toilet seats.The Mayfair is made out of molded wood and done in a slightly glossy white finish.  It has a little bit of design flair with the small indentation that runs the perimeter of the lid.  The seat is made of high quality materials and feels sturdy and well assembled.  It fits and matches my circa 1985 white Mansfield toilet well.Installing the Mayfair is very simple and took me about 10 minutes including the removal of my old toilet seat.  You simply unlock the lift off hinges and snap in the bolts and then you feed the bolts through the holes in the toilet and tighten the plastic lower nuts.  To ensure a tight fit the Mayfair comes with special bolts wherein the bottom part of the bolt snaps off when they are completely tightened.  They work well and the seat is firmly in place.The two special features of this toilet seat are the lift-off and slow close features.  The lift off features allows you to unlock the toilet seat from the bolts and remove it for easy cleaning.  The slow close feature prevents the toilet seat from slamming down and works very well slowly letting the seat and lid settle into place.Unfortunately the seat itself is very flat and has little contour.  The plastic toilet seat I used to have was curved and formed to fit a posterior and was more comfortable to sit on than the Mayfair.All in all... it's not the most cosseting toilet seat but it's easy to clean installs quickly and closes without slamming.,Y,Y,flat,contour,

B00004WA4C,I am looking for a smoke alarm that can detect cigarette smoke Will this one work?,Takes 3 AA batteries. Comes with the first set. The Detector comes with a baseplate that mounts to the wall with included screws and anchor for dry wall. After the plate installs the unit twists on to the plate and thats how you can remove and change batteries. The center button is good for shutting off the detector when it sounds. After pushing the button it will disable it temporarily till the room is cleared. If it isn't it will go off again.I think this is a great product for the price.

B00004WA4C,I am looking for a smoke alarm that can detect cigarette smoke Will this one work?,This alarm was easy to install and pretty easy to use. Let me just show you the pros and cons to show you how I feel about this little plastic disk.Pros:*It works as a smoke/carbon monoxide alarm (I feel safe that if there was a real fire this thing would tell me)*It was really easy to install on my ceilingCons:*It is WAY too sensitive. It goes off all the time when I cook or roast something especially. And it will keep detecting the 'smoke' for hours after it has aired out.*I still have NO idea how to 'mute' it when it goes off when I cook. There is only one button so there is not a whole lot I can do.In Conclusion:This is not a good alarm for safety. Do not get it. The only way I can 'mute' it when I cook is to take it off the ceiling and take out the batteries whenever it goes off. Since it takes a few hours to stop detecting any hint of smoke and going off I usually leave it off for the day or through the night. If I forget and have it off longer or if there was an unlucky fire this alarm wouldn't do anything because it is sitting on my table with its batteries out. If I had to make the purchase again I would not at all get this alarm.,Y,N,cigarette,,
B00004WA4C,I am looking for a smoke alarm that can detect cigarette smoke Will this one work?,I purchased and installed two of these units in my home. Very simple to install. The units are a little bigger than a single smoke detector but not too much bigger. It went off this morning when I was cooking. The kitchen filled with smoke and the unit started beeping and yelling FIRE! I feel confident that this unit works. Our old detector (single detection unit) was effective and saved our lives. I will never be without one. This detector is much louder than our old unit. I am confident that this will be effective if ever needed. For the price this is a great value.,Y,N,cigarette,,
B00004WA4C,I am looking for a smoke alarm that can detect cigarette smoke Will this one work?,This unit that shows the front load batteries is definitely different from the rear load even though they have nearly identical part numbers.

Also one uses 3 AAA batteries and one only uses 2.,Y,N,cigarette,,
B00004WA4C,I am looking for a smoke alarm that can detect cigarette smoke Will this one work?,"After someone explained to me that ""beeping"" noises of smoke alarms do not always wake people (especially children) I looked into this `talking alarm'.  It is amazing.  Instead of that annoying `beep-beep' you hear either a vocal ""Fire!  Fire!"" or ""Carbon Monoxide!"".  Not all smoke alarms will detect carbon monoxide and any firefighter policeman or paramedic will tell you that carbon monoxide can be just as deadly.  Plus this kit comes with batteries and a DVD that shows firefighters in action.  This is the kind of protection every family needs and at the price it can't be beat.  You can easily test it weekly and a small green light will tell you if the batteries are functional (you should change them every year anyway).  When the batteries are low the red light flashes and a voice warns you along with a 'chirp'.  This is a no-brainer!",Y,N,cigarette,,

One thing I do like is the ""HUSH"" button.  A simple tap will silence an annoying unwanted announcement.

B00004XOVI,Does this work on carpet?,Last November we noticed our basement ceiling bulging with water that had accumulated for months. The water line into our refrigerator came loose and dripped water down to our basement thru the floor. The restoration company told us that this happens 'more frequently than you would imagine.'Our restoration costs exceeded $6000 for the repair new carpet kitchen floor refinishing etc. A few weeks ago our kitchen wood floor was refinished (last step in the restoration). The refinisher was moving the refrigerator back into place when he noticed some dry water stains coming from the ice maker. He suggested not turning the water back on until we had it checked out. Since I had a repairman service the refrigerator after the leak I wasn't too sure it was still a problem. Anyway I put the Zircon alarm behind the fridge on the floor (just in case) and we pushed the unit back into place.  A few days later we turned the water back on and forgot about it. Last week as we were getting ready to leave for a night out the alarm sounded. I immediately pulled the fridge out and found a puddle of water on the floor. Had we not had the Zircon alarm we would be facing additional restoration of our kitchen and basement. The water to the fridge was shut off and we are now looking to buy a new one.I purchased three of the Zircon Leak Alerts and placed them around our water heater and our steam boiler. I rest better at night knowing the alarms will warn us of any potential leak problems.,Y,N,carpet,,
B00004XOVI,Does this work on carpet?,While this device definitely does a good job to sound the alert when water is in an area the alarm is too soft for me. I would say that if it's on the same floor that you are on the device would be good. When it's in the basement it's just barely audible on the first floor and forget it on the 2nd floor. I would double up on these so that you get double the sound. I would date the battery and replace them at least once a year.,Y,N,carpet,,

The trick to its use is to recognize the inherent limitation of all rotary tools.They are high-speed low-torque tools.  The work is done in the same way that a dentist's drill works:  Very light pressure lets the bit in effect shave away the material.  As the manual says you need to adjust the tool so the bit is very close to the workpiece then slowly lower the bit into it.This means you can't use the Dremel drill press the same way you would use a full-size drill press where you can bear down on the lever and force the bit to dig into the work.

I too had trouble with the 1/32"" bits ""walking"" but discovered that the problem in my case was largely due to the bits not being straight the bits not having centered tips the bearing in the Dremel 325-2 being loose in the tool housing and not currently having the means to run the tool at a much lower speed. To minimized bit wobble I trimmed the shaft of the bits so I could insert them as far as possible into the chuck leaving only about 1/8"" of the bit exposed.

For a compressor to work this well after being used this hard it deserves 5 stars after all.]Update after first two weeks:  Best compressor we have.  The Makita is very quiet.  It is now the only one the guys will use indoors hanging cabinets subflooring beadboard etc...  The Makita makes a soft plubathubathubathubathuba sound; compared to the GROWkROWkROWkROWkROWk of our pancake compressor.  When the Makita runs it stays in one place and doesn't shake the coffee cups off the sawhorses.  Some of our other compressors will shake the fillings out of your teeth.  The Makita also builds pressure fast.  It cycles fairly often due to the single small tank but it fills quickly so it actually has to run very little.  I have installed the replacement motor shroud.  Amazon customer support was great.  You can read the rest of the review but take it from me that this is a wonderful compressor at a great price.  Looks like I'll be ordering one or two more.  Even with the shipping damage I highly recommend this item.Original review:Yes mine arrived damaged somewhat.  You can read many other reviews with the same problem.  The plastic shroud over the compressor was broken in several pieces.  5 minutes with some duct tape and everything was back in place.  All the fittings were in fine shape and the shroud does not prevent the compressor from being used.  So even though I had to tape the shroud back together I am giving this 4.5 stars.  Simply because it works so well.  (Nothing important was damaged on mine.  I'll hold off on other observations about the packing and shipping until the end of the review.)Ok on to the real review...  I use 4 other compressors (from Ingersol Rand DeWalt Porter Cable and Northern Industrial).  I have found these all either too heavy/big too noisy or both.  My Porter Cable pancake compressor is so loud I even bought a longer hose so I could get farther away from it.  I have searched a long time to find a good portable job site compressor.  I believe I have found it.  This Makita beats every portable job site compressor I have ever seen.  Hands down.  In fact I have given my pancake compressor away.  I will keep the NI compressor in the garage to fill up tires.  The DeWalt will be reserved for big jobs where I can leave it on-site for a while.So what are my impressions of the MAC700?-First it is quiet.  Very quiet.  My wife can even watch ""This Old House"" in the next room without complaining.  (The circular saw gets on her nerves however.)-Second it is narrow.  This makes it easy to pass between wall studs or floor joists when moving from one room to the other.  Of course you can't just throw it in the bed of your truck at the end of the day.  You will need to tie it down to keep it from tipping over in transit.-Third it is light in weight.  Sort of.  It is heavy enough to not vibrate and dance across a floor while still being light enough to carry for short distances.  (It is however a two handed grunt to get it up in the truck bed. )-Forth. Did I mention it is quiet?  Well it also fills very quickly.  Because of the small tank a nail gun will bleed it down pretty quick.  But because it recovers so fast you will not notice it when working.-Fifth the quality of the unit is superb.  Especially the tank drain valve.-Sixth it's a chick magnet.  I'm too old for such nonsense but judging from the reaction of my 18 year old daughter (""It's so cute!"") I'd say all you younger guys (and gals!) out there would be proud to have this little compressor accompany you on your next job!  It will improve the appearance of  just about any pick-up bed.",Y,N,,,
B0001Q2VK0,Some compressors hose couplings do not need you to retract the fitting sleeve to insert the hose. Can anyone say if this has that?,If you own your home this is a must have. Cars trucks campers riding lawnmowers anything with air tires. Air tools if you are not use to them also work great off this unit. These tools once you have this compressor are very reasonable to buy and work great saving you money. I am out from town some distance and it is a real pain to get air when you need it particularly your riding mower tires. Good  solid unit makita quality easy to use very safe. A little heavy so get a little cart or handtruck and you'll be in business. also you'll need a quality air hose and a good air valve and possibly some additional connectors. All found on amazon for a good price. Remember to keep all tires properly filled it will save you gas money over time and it may sve a life. If you have a air compressor at hand you are more likly to keep up with that. Whats your families safty worth.,Y,N,,,
B0001Q2VK0,Some compressors hose couplings do not need you to retract the fitting sleeve to insert the hose. Can anyone say if this has that?,I was debating if the added cost over C***sm** would be worth it.  Though it was ~$80 more I can say that it clearly is a great unit.  It was packaged real well (contrary to some other reviews) and arrived in great shape.  There will be some oil leakage in the box this is from manufacturing startup and testing - it shouldn't concern you at all.  Just add the oil provided and go through the break in procedures thoroughly.  Personally I went through multiple break in cycles with cool down time between them.  An investment like this will need a bit of TLC but will serve you well.Highly recommended Amazon again provided everything in great condition and one day ahead of schedule.Well pleased._________  Update 10/2/2013After using this for some time now I have to say it is the perfect tool for the home hobbyist that just wants a portable unit to do things around the house.  This has come into use more than I thought it would and drives the air accessories very well.,Y,N,,,
B0001Q2VK0,Some compressors hose couplings do not need you to retract the fitting sleeve to insert the hose. Can anyone say if this has that?,No cracked shroud for me. Instructions could've been better for first time setup as was already mentioned in the feedback but anyone who saw two things in a bag that screw in and two white flimsy caps could figure it out pretty easily. Every air compressor I've ever had that used oil had the same window same red dot that you fill up to so that was pretty intuitive as well. The release valve (ball valve w/lever) is great - I hate the kind with the little screw valve you can't quite turn by hand.What really struck me is how quiet this thing is. It's like use in the other room with the door shut and you won't wake the kids up quiet. Our vacuum cleaner is louder. It reminded me of an aquarium pump. I had to test it out after I ran it not under load for about 35 minutes. I used a roofing nailer and hit nails in as fast as I could holding the trigger down. It kicked on after several nails (about 5 shingles worth in about 20 seconds) but the pressure never got too low for the job. That's with the psi up and nailing into solid 2x4. I have no doubt this air compressor could keep up with a framing nailer or maybe even two roofing nailers on a manifold setup.It is heavy but not so much so you can't carry it to where it needs to go. Considering it has a beefier motor than my wheeled 20 gallon compressor it makes sense. Well-made things shouldn't be light. It should be expected if you want a portable compressor you can actually DO something with. If you're just going to be doing some air brushing some light stapling/brad nailing etc. don't care about how loud it is and want your kid to be able to cart it around easy when they want to airbrush some designs on their skateboard or something you may want a cheaper model like a single hotdog-tank Bostitch they have on sale for $129. If you need to throw some shingles on your garage and can lift a bag of chicken feed by yourself go with this Makita.,Y,N,,,
B0001Q2VK0,Some compressors hose couplings do not need you to retract the fitting sleeve to insert the hose. Can anyone say if this has that?,Really nice upgrade for those &#34;pancake&#34; compressor owners. No damage on my unit arrived in real nice shape packaging was not taxed or mishandled.  As I have only completed the break in and verified pressure switch and regulator function.  I can not give a long term evaluation...but I can say this a very well built unit and a nice slender design...a bit heavy if your wife girlfriend or feminine significant other must use plan to purchase a long enough hose and strategic storage location that will meet their needs for use.,Y,N,,,
B0001Q2VK0,Some compressors hose couplings do not need you to retract the fitting sleeve to insert the hose. Can anyone say if this has that?,"Can not give a better rating as I have waited 2 delivery times to find each time the compressor is delivered destroyed ""damaged"" in the box. This last time the UPS guy witnessed the opening. I haven't seen it run yet after a month of waiting. I kinda need a compressor is why I bought and paid for it. Get the hint. I can not recommend this compressor if you are really in need of one.They can not seem to get it delivered with out destroying it.We are waiting/going on the 3x third delivery now. Amazon has been great to handle each issue free of charge and is now expediting shipping to help even more. We will be getting a Senco if this one is not shipped correctly.Well its delivery day and we are waiting. I just received an email stating that Amazon was going to double bill me. back on the phone 4 calls trying to get a supervisor. I am on hold for hours and as I said 4 calls. Cant cook breakfast this is turning into a nightmare. Billed 2x or threat of it anyway On the phone with customer service. They refused to escalate the call.Looks like getting screwed by Amazon double billed and no compressor.Hours Later;I am still trying to stop Amazon from double billing me. I still have no compressor.Have you ever had so much trouble that you did not even want the item you bought and paid for.Amazon has offered no compensation for all the trouble. Said they wouldn't refund until they receive the damaged compressors back. Got screwed on this deal.This sucks! 3 weeks and screwed every step of the way. If Amazon gave me the compressor for free it would not make up for the hassle. The call center CS when the issues are serious are trained liars!Hour later;Low and behold I got a manager on the Chat. He offered a $50 refund for all the hassle which is not much for the trouble but is commendable on his part. We will see if it shows up today and in what condition. Lots of reviews say the shipping/packaging is a real problem so beware..This can happen to you.Noticed after unpacking and packing these ""if the compressor is on its side in the box for any reason the weight of the compressor the way it's packed will break the shroud""! Poor packaging!None of this is a review of the MAC700 but rather my experience trying to obtain one from AMAZON wish me luck! I still haven't heard it run yet. I am wondering if I am supposed to have one of these?Well it is supposed to be here no later than 8pm today which is a little over an hour away deadline.Think they will make it with a compressor that isn't torn up?NO they did not make it never showed up the delivery I was promised as a concession.Can not recommend sorry..Bad reviews all around on this thing coming damaged. I do not see how it gets 4.5 stars as every 3 or 4 feedback is destroyed or comes reconditioned. Big rip off. How many are not even reported on the feedback. AMAZON is covering this up.Anyone want to know how this turned out. It never showed up. The customer service say that it got held up no explanation and it should be in next week Tuesday. The customer service are trained liars and have hurt my business. Anyone that needs a compressor would be nuts to try and buy this from Amazon. They say it will take 3 days to get me a refund so I can buy something else. I suspect that is also more deception and that I will be back on the phone resolving that as well.PS : Read all the feedback. I believe they are manipulating the feedback score. These compressors are all coming busted up or rebuilt by Amazon and sold as new.SCAM",Y,N,,,
B0001Q2VK0,Some compressors hose couplings do not need you to retract the fitting sleeve to insert the hose. Can anyone say if this has that?,Like many others my compressor arrived with the plastic shroud in seven pieces.  It would not take much to correct the packaging to prevent this from hapening.  One of those inflated plastic bubles taped to the front of the shroud would stop the leading edge of the shroud from hitting the cardboard insert and putting enough pressure on it to cause it to break.  Putting large red arrows on the box and printing this end up in large letters would also help as the small red arrows are easily overlooked.  My unit came with oil all over the cardboard insert and an imprint of where the leading edge of the shroud had pressed into the cardboard.  This was a good indication that the box had been laid on its side.  I also own the MAC2400 which is great but really heavy.  As Amazon will not replace this unit I have returned it and have ordered another from Home Depot.Com for the same amount plus sales tax.  I hope this one comes in one piece.,Y,N,,,

B00004U6A8,"Will these disks fit the ""DEWALT D26451 3-Amp 5-Inch Random-Orbit Sander"" I just ordered?",I ordered this a while back and reordered it as soon as I needed more. I like to be stocked on accessories in order to avoid some of the annoyance of arriving at a project realizing that I need to go back to the store for a single small item like this. The fact that this package brings the basic spectrum of common grits for wood is really great. The discs themselves hold up just as well as 'better' brand discs I'used.,Y,N,,,
B00004U6A8,"Will these disks fit the ""DEWALT D26451 3-Amp 5-Inch Random-Orbit Sander"" I just ordered?",Just what I needed I was sanding three french doors and needed a few different types of sanding paper and then I came across this bundle. It had all the different grit sand papers that i needed to start from a rough grit and take off the old stain to then go finer.. If you have not done this before  trust me this is a must.. other wise you will have swirl marks and scratches  on whatever youre sanding and the worst part is that they show up once you start putting the new stain on. The sanding pads fit perfectly on my Dewalt 5 inch random orbit sander.. and these are great quality and do not rip easily.. Recommend these to any one from a novice to a professional sander.. Great value,Y,Y,,,

B00004U6A8,"Will these disks fit the ""DEWALT D26451 3-Amp 5-Inch Random-Orbit Sander"" I just ordered?",I recently purchased the Dewalt D26451 random-orbit sander and as an add-on I purchased thisassortment set of sanding discs.So cool.

So fast and easy to change out pads and get to the sanding.The assortment pack offers 10 each of 80 100 120 150 and 220. In my first two projects I managed to use severalof each grit.

B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,Fast way to disconnect and reconnect things from the Dremel Tool.Allows you to connect more accessories quickly and securely.It was shipped quickly and got to me early.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,From my experience this should be built into any rotary tool design. This fit on my Black & Decker RTX-B without issue.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,This little add-on tool is excellent.It allows you to quickly switch from one attachment to another.It holds on even when you are cutting iron/steel(note read manual on this and be careful.),Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,i do not know why dremel just does not supply this with its tools automatically...  this is one great idea and works like a charm,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,Works well. Very happy with it. Does what I need doing. Very very useful. Thank you for it. Good show.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,Good tool for what it does. Much quicker and easier then the standard chuck. If you change tools on your Dremel... this is a must have.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,Simple and easy to use.  Lets you change bits withoutany tools.  Does not let you use any bits larger than thestandard Dremel Chuck does don't let the picture misleadyou.,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,Like everyone says this makes switching out bits so much easier. I don't know why I waited so long to get this. I don't see any downsides to it except that it doesn't fit the largest bits but I've never needed to use anything with my Dremel 4000 that this couldn't fit. This should come standard with every Dremel in my opinion. I guess having all these separate accessories is just Dremel's way of making a buck but whatever. It's a good product so I don't mind supporting them.,Y,Y,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,this Accessory is a great help when you need change repeatly your bits I improve the model (Dremel 400-6/90 400 Series XPR Variable Speed Rotary Tool) with this one,Y,N,,,
B0000302ZV,does it work with a 4000 model,It didn't say it would work for the 4000 Dremel (But it does!).I got it just to try it out but realized I had to have it for my 4000 because I'm using small diamond bits which wouldn't work without it.Read some other comments that said it wouldn't hold their tools.  Not had that issue.  I love it.,Y,Y,,,
B000SJO5QI,Will this lid work with older commodes?,,Y,N,,,
B000SJO5QI,Will this lid work with older commodes?,No more slamming toilet seat noises. My sons are much more likely to put the seat down. My wife and daughter haven't complained since. A real peace keeper. Highly recommended. Oh and the seat itself is very well made too...,Y,N,,,
B000SJO5QI,Will this lid work with older commodes?,The slow close toilet seats by Mayfair are excellent!  I purchased 3 to replace our 12 year old toilet seats (solid wood).  These toilet seats are of good quality and the slow close mechanism works great. Some have said they close too slowly but that has not been our experience.  They clean up nicely and fit our existing toilets without any problems.  The quick release is also a real benefit to owning these.  The only downside is now when I go to other houses and use their restrooms I tend to drop the toilet seat making a loud bang instead of the quiet close. Good product a little expensive but well worth it.,Y,N,,,
B000SJO5QI,Will this lid work with older commodes?,Good value for the price.  Used this for commode in newly remodeled bathroom.  All bathrooms now have slow close type seats.  I replaced the lid screws with stainless steel screws as the ones that the manufacturer uses will rust and leave brown stains after a year or two.  I weigh about 150 lbs so I expect this seat will not break from my use.  Someone much heavier may have a breakage problem since this seat is most likely made from glued composite wood not from solid wood.,Y,N,,,
B000SJO5QI,Will this lid work with older commodes?,This works as indicated; good slow soft close but will go down quickly with no problem if you push on it. It's a little heavier and more comfortable that the standard plastic toilet seats that come with new toilets.,Y,N,,,
B000SJO5QI,Will this lid work with older commodes?,I have small children in my household who sometimes don't understand that it's not okay to let the toilet seats slam close.  The Mayfair Slow-Close toilet seat is a good solution for avoiding those loud bangs.  I have to warn you though it is really slow.  If you're impatient you can push them down by force.  I think I would've preferred a free gliding hinge that'd slow down for the last inch or two for more convenience but that's nitpicking.Installing the seat was easy.  If you can put two legos together and use a wrench you can install this toilet seat.  I was impressed at how stable it was after installation.  No movement side to side.The seat seems well made and durable.  The toilet seat that I replaced was an older Mayfair that I'd actually been considering replacing.  The Slow-Close model is a good choice albeit a bit more of an expensive one than a standard seat.  But if you're looking for a Slow-Close seat you can't go wrong with the Mayfair.,Y,Y,,,
B000SJO5QI,Will this lid work with older commodes?,I bought two of these. They work great. I have a habbit of closing the lid. No more slamming the toilet seat!,Y,N,,,
B000SJO5QI,Will this lid work with older commodes?,We replaced an older model toilet seat that had lift-off hinges and had gotten stained by bleach.  This new Mayfair installed pretty easily.  It looks good and appears to be plenty sturdy.  It is a nice feature to have the slow-close especially if you have children.  Therefore so far so good and I would recommend.,Y,Y,,,
B000SJO5QI,Will this lid work with older commodes?,I got this to replace an older seat that was cheaper both in quality and cost. For just a few dollars more you can get this level of quality!!First this is very easy to install. It has an odd bolt design in that once it's tightened the bottom part snaps off - by design. The seat does not shift due to the mounting design which was a big complaint about our old seat. Also the seat has a hinge that with a small turn releases the seat from the mounting so the toilet can be cleaned far more easily and thoroughly. I love this feature! The slow closing (no slamming lid!) feature is also very nice to have. Composed of molded wood and then laminated (at least the white version which I have) the seat is solid and considerably more dense than the older seat we had. We've only just gotten this so I can't say how it holds up but so far we are delighted with this product and can recommend it without reservation.,Y,Y,,,
B000SJO5QI,Will this lid work with older commodes?,This is a contemporary looking toilet seat that will go with any decor. I have an older house and older fixtures and this matches well but also adds an aire of modernity to the decor.It is heavy well constructed and very easy to install. Installs really with only a 1/2 socket driver in minutes. The slow close is nice as I have small children in the house.,Y,N,,,

B003IT5F14,does this have a constant on switch? thank you.,This sharpener works well so far.  I'll see how it does once all my knives are sharpened.  I do know it works well on tools too.  It's a tiny bit of a hassle to have to change the belt for a finer blade but that's not a huge deal unless you're in a hurry. All in all I do recommend this product.  I'm waiting to see if it works on a lawn mower blade!,N,N,,,
B003IT5F14,does this have a constant on switch? thank you.,It does a great job on SMALL sharpening jobs knives scissors and such.  However to get a truly good edge you'll need to to get the fine belts as well.  Comes with a sharpening guide for getting the right angles.  If you have some light sharpening to do it knocks it out pretty quick.,N,N,,,
B003IT5F14,does this have a constant on switch? thank you.,It works like they say it does on some knives but smaller bladed knives are harder to sharpen. I have a kershaw knife with a tanto blade Very hard to sharpen it after a few min I stopped trying and switched to a regular blade kershaw and it was shaving sharp in less than 1 min minus the belt change. I guess I need more practice with it. UPDATE:I went to the in-laws house Sharpened all the guys knives that were over then they busted out all their kitchen knives. Sharpened around 15 knives. They were all shaving sharp from just using the medium grit belt on all the kitchen knives anyway. So this does work very well but if you have a knife like a tanto blade its going to be very hard to follow the angle of the knife and sharpen it correctly. For all other knives I don't see how you could sharpen a knife any faster.,N,N,,,
B003IT5F14,does this have a constant on switch? thank you.,My knife sharpener was not getting the job done anymore and I saw this online and decided to give it a try. Boy does it do a great job with little time and amazing results. You can easily shave the hair on your arm with the edge this gives you. If you are like me you just can't stand a dull knife well this will take care of that problem real quick. This is a good product fairly inexpensive and easy to use.,N,N,,,
B003IT5F14,does this have a constant on switch? thank you.,"Unvelievable tool!I guess I've bought about every kind of knife sharpener known to man over the years and each has its own minor or major drawback. Some remove too much of the blade without actually creating a truly sharp cutting edge; some require messy oils and stones of varying grit; still others just make a lot of noise and produce a ground-down but relatively dull knife in the end.The Work Sharp sharpener is the ONLY tool that delivers a scalpel-edge to virtually any knife with no learning curve and no lengthy process. A few simple passes on each side of the blade and you have a truly sharp knife. Switch to the honing belt and repeat and you will end up with what they call a ""scary sharp"" cutting edge. Believe me it is.Certainly not the most expensive sharpener out there but undeniably the finest sharpener ever designed. I've recommended it to several friends and they all feel exactly as I do. Buy this thing with absolute confidence.By the way the process used by Work Sharp is exactly what knife factories use when they deliver their blades to customers in the first place. Hard to argue with that.",N,N,,,
B003IT5F14,does this have a constant on switch? thank you.,I have used lots of knife sharpeners and i have to say this is probably the fastest and does give you a nice edge but keep in mind it does have its limitations and its not the answer to all your knife sharpening needs and that's why i have several different kinds. but for the casual sharpening it will work fine!,N,N,,,
B003IT5F14,does this have a constant on switch? thank you.,I have only used this sharpener twice since I bought it.  However it does a really good job and does it quickly and effortlessly.,N,N,,,

B005VCJNYG,will it fit on a 1 inch ring mount?,Although this isn't a 1000 lumen flashlight I've still given it five stars. It's very bright the fit and finish are great and so far it's held up to my use.I'm always on the lookout for brighter / better / newer flashlights and lanterns. I have many different brands and models (as Amazon can testify to) and this is one I recommend regularly. The light pattern is more of a flood than a &#34;thrower&#34; and it works fine even at 100 yards.

It is a good bright flashlight and the batteries are rechargable. The lense part is larger than my other similar flashlights. I would not mount this on a firearm for that reason. I prefer the smaller lense area. They give off the same amount of light just less to bump into things when moving.,Y,N,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it fit on a 1 inch ring mount?,This is the only light I need it is small and compact with a very bright lite if you face it up it will light the whole room go for one you will be amazed how bright they are,Y,N,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it fit on a 1 inch ring mount?,For the price this is an excellent flashlight.  Extremely bright - I would say the 1000 lumen claim is fairly accurate.  Has Strobe and SOS modes by cycling through the rubber activation button at the rear of the light.  Standard diameter of tube should fit most combat mounts out there.  Would buy again..,Y,N,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it fit on a 1 inch ring mount?,yes there are better flashlights  but this is a very good value for the money you spend... all the modes work as they should.. and it is very bright  the fit and finish are very good.. and if you buy one more than likely  you buy a second,Y,N,,,

B000O8OTNC,I have a folding serrated carbon bladed hunting knife I absolutely love (it can cut through anything) can this sharpener work on this ?,it's like those amazing yellow hand sharpeners from walmart with the carbide bits in them but smaller with more stuff and completely better. :D,Y,N,,,
B000O8OTNC,I have a folding serrated carbon bladed hunting knife I absolutely love (it can cut through anything) can this sharpener work on this ?,Works great. small and handy and brings a fine sharp end to my blades. Star removed for safety; you've got to grip carefully.,Y,N,,,
B000O8OTNC,I have a folding serrated carbon bladed hunting knife I absolutely love (it can cut through anything) can this sharpener work on this ?,I have a handfull of sharpeners and to be completely im not &#34;shaving sharp&#34; talented on a stone. These pocket and countertop sharpeners fill the void between a skilled knife sharpener and a novice.  With a handfull of swipes just about anyone with a fairly steady hand can put a respectable edge on a knife.  If i break or loose this pocket model i wont think twice about ordering another it a very handy tool to have in your pocket or glovebox if you need to touch up a edge.  Thinner bladed knives will sharpen up quicker this little gem did wonder on my S.O.G  Warning its small and if you have a very dull blade you would be better served to start your edge with another device as you just hold this one with a couple fingers and drag your blades through it.. If anything i would even go as far as saying this is a little on the unsafe side if your not holding onto the device very very firmly.  I will keep my already sharp knives in top shape with the occasional swipe through this device.,Y,N,,,

B000O8OTNC,I have a folding serrated carbon bladed hunting knife I absolutely love (it can cut through anything) can this sharpener work on this ?,This lil sharpener actually works great for sharpening up my machetes. And The diamond rod works well enough on serrations. Though it does kind of dull my thin bladed folding knives... For all who's Diamond rod for sharpening serrations have broken off...it's an 8 dollar pocket sharpener and the rod is basically hard plastic. You don't need alot of pressure when using the rod. And try a squirt of WD40 in the rod's hinge and work it in there. It is kind of useful for the price.,Y,Y,,,
B000O8OTNC,I have a folding serrated carbon bladed hunting knife I absolutely love (it can cut through anything) can this sharpener work on this ?,With the two sides carbide and ceramic it's a jiffy to either put a new edge on a dull blade to finish off a sharpening job or to use the folding rod to sharpen a serrated blade.  Pocket carriable compact inexpensive.  A winner for sure.,Y,Y,,,
B000O8OTNC,I have a folding serrated carbon bladed hunting knife I absolutely love (it can cut through anything) can this sharpener work on this ?,I bought this a little while back and I love it I wouldn't trade if for anything.

B00828MZ3W,Can you use regular double A batteries with this flashlight?,good cheap little flash light.you can pull it end out to make the light more of a beam or a wide flood.i use it almost daily for work.  batteries last about four months or so.  i would recommend.,Y,N,,,
B00828MZ3W,Can you use regular double A batteries with this flashlight?,These flashlights are really great ! I love them. They fit easily in your pocket or wife's purse. They are either on or off no more 3 pushes on the on/off switch to get the wanted result. Lens on head has a simple sliding head adjustment for wide beam or small concentrated beam. No switch pressing involved. Very Very bright too !!!  Great outdoors or inside. Heavy duty all metal construction with good useable metal pocket clip too. (Does anybody out there really need a strobe light function ?)No more &#34;Where is the damn flashlight ?&#34;  anymore. Now...Its in my pocket along with my pocket knife ready to go. I'm buying more. It a little bit of a wait as they ship from China by regular mail but worth the wait !!I'm buying more... They each hold just one single AA battery not the tiny AAA ones.. That why they are so small but powerful.,Y,N,,,
B00828MZ3W,Can you use regular double A batteries with this flashlight?,Love this great little flashlight. I use a flashlight every night. Before now I had a problem using a light that was bright enough and small enough to easily fit in my shirt or pant pocket or held in my mouth when necessary. No longer. This little gem performs brighter and better than 90% of MUCH larger lights on the market. You need a handy little BRIGHT light this is what you want.The one drawback because this light is so bright and powerful it burns through batts fairly quickly. I have overcome this drawback by using a couple of rechargeable NIMH batteries. The NIMH batts provide the best longest life power. With two of these batts I use one in the light while the second charges. That said I'm never at a loss for a batt for this light.Just FYI using the light every night and the NIMH rechargeable batts a single batt lasts about two weeks. I replace the batt with the newly recharged batt. Have been doing so for almost two years now. The combo of this bright little light with the two rechargeable NIMH batts have been excellent.If you buy this light planning on using only regular alkaline batts don't. Due to it's power it will burn through batts quickly enough to make it economically infeasible. Use the rechargeable NIMH batts and it will work for you.,Y,N,,,
B00828MZ3W,Can you use regular double A batteries with this flashlight?,I'm a big fan of flashlights that take AA and AAA batteries so I tried one of these due to the price and I'm very happy with it. I ended up buying some of those high-voltage AA batteries to get the extra brightness and they definitely make a difference though the batteries I bought (cheap ones here on Amazon) don't seem to hold a charge as long as I'd like. Overall though for this price it's a great flashlight and I now own two. Beware though I thought I ordered two of the same but they are slightly different in both looks and performance so there are multiple versions of this same light out there. Regardless they're bright and pretty darn durable. I have one mounted on my shotgun and one I keep at my bedside as my primary light when things make nose at night. I don't think you can go wrong with this light.,Y,Y,,,
B00828MZ3W,Can you use regular double A batteries with this flashlight?,they are small and put out a good deal of light for such a small flashlight plus it uses AA batteries.,Y,Y,,,
B00828MZ3W,Can you use regular double A batteries with this flashlight?,After buying one of these thinking it was great; and then reading that it will accept Li-Ion batteries purchasing a 2-battery + charger package and seeing how much brighter it was compared to the original amazing performance plus Li-Ion don't die if you don't use them for a few months - I bought 4 more. Sorry for the run-on sentence. One for each of my kids (with charger and batteries) and another for my briefcase. These are great and the zoom allows them to illuminate things very far away or wide angle up close. The construction is very solid - not plastic. My kids love them. The charger plus 2 Li-Ion AA batteries cost $15 at Amazon. Very worth it to be brighter and not to worry about the batteries being dead when you need the flashlight. Also if you use the flashlight in cold weather LEDs love cold weather and Li-Ion batteries aren't affected nearly as much as most batteries.,Y,Y,,,
B00828MZ3W,Can you use regular double A batteries with this flashlight?,I recd. them last week after a few weeks wait but very happy with it especially the price so I'll be ordering more in the near future for giveaways back home in P.I. It does all it says in the add good about it is it take a double AA batteries which is easy to find back home.,Y,Y,,,

B00009LI4K,Would these block out someone talking?,It seems silly to sit in an office environment wearing industrial hearing protection and yet that's exactly what has happened where I work.  Several of us purchased these to block out the office noise and after awhile our management noticed and bought enough of them for the rest of the team.  With these on most talking and office noise is reduced to a whisper.Depending on your head size these might be too tight however they do stretch if you pull them apart a bit.I'm fairly prone to sweating but these don't overheat me at all.,Y,Y,,,
B00009LI4K,Would these block out someone talking?,I got similar earmuffs in a different package at a local store that cost over $9 more.  But they seem identical and are the same brand.  These seem like good quality.  They really muffle sound of yard equipment  But I can still hear if someone needs to talk to me.  The headband part of it is kind of cheap but works fine.,Y,Y,,,
B00009LI4K,Would these block out someone talking?,I was seriously surprised at the decible loss that these cans delivered.  I got them delivered to my office and immeadiatly used them to tune out my coworkers.  If somebody is talking directly to you in a normal voice you can still hear them albit barley. They block out all ambiant noise.  These are a really nice for my home rennovation project.  Easy to tak on and off easy to adjust and hard to miss if you set them down.,Y,Y,,,
B00009LI4K,Would these block out someone talking?,Watch any TV show where people are working with noisy equipment and you will see them wearing these muffs (easy to spot with the red band) there is a reason why they have them because they are comfortable and work!I am 28 I have been working construction for 8 years I never wore hearing protection and just lifted my shoulder up to cover my right ear as I cut stuff. The result? An early start to hearing loss which only gets worse if I hear loud noises. I started wearing a pair of the nicer Stanley ear muffs you would find at Menards (/Stanley-RST-63007) and they were uncomfortable over a long period of time. I got the 3M ones and will not trade them for anything. They are very soft and comfortable yes they are a bit bigger but that size means more hearing protection. They block out all soft noises its even hard to hear someone talking. Louder noises are very faint. A must buy!,Y,Y,,,
B00009LI4K,Would these block out someone talking?,I suppose I am one of those people who needs quiet in order to create. The people next to my office frequently listen to music while working or have loud office meetings. I bought these ear muffs to control my environment. I would say that it cuts out 99% of the sounds. If there is someone talking I can hear a distant muffled garble very indistinct and generally not bothersome at all. Occasionally I will hear a distant bass note or a drum beat depending on the type of music he is listening to.I would guess that these muffs would significantly reduce music you might hear in an apartment situation although I haven't tested them in that environment yet. My only complaint is that after an hour or so the muffs can start to seem a bit tight (even though initially they are extremely comfortable). I occasionally have to take a break for 10 minutes or so before I put them back on. I would imagine that if I were walking around it would keep the circulation going better (I sit at a computer). If I were going to study at a loud library or other public space these would definitely allow improved concentration.Well worth the money and much better than the extremely uncomfortable brand I bought at my local box store.,Y,Y,,,
B00009LI4K,Would these block out someone talking?,I am well pleased with the ear muffs. They appear to be well made . I have used them often and like the way they block loud sounds but I am still able to hear if someone speaks to me.,Y,Y,,,
B00009LI4K,Would these block out someone talking?,Not too much I can say. I bought these for ear protection at the shooting range. They work well. If there is someone next to me I can hear them talking (like someone showing me a new gun) but I don't get deafened by sound of gunfire. I have not used these anywhere but the range so I can't speak to any other uses.,Y,Y,,,

B000OQ21CA,Will this work for speaker wire?,If u got to ever do a splice boxes all day you will love this thing it takes a lil time to perfect but once you do your hands will thank you. I wouldn't keep it in my pocket all the time but anytime I know I got to do a lot of splicing this is my weapon of chose. It's is also good for data and fire alarm as well love this thing and so do other. I always get the what is that. Wow nice tool with this thing.,Y,N,,,
B000OQ21CA,Will this work for speaker wire?,This tool is awesome. i am glad i purchased itI use it in the electrical lab and i've used it to strip 2.5 mm twin lighting wire. and different awg wires with ease.What took my peers 3 minutes to do I take 7 Seconds. I am a proud owner of this toolWhat i do notice is that if the cable you are stripping has imperfections caused by some by someone using a utility knife to strip it; it will not grip it properly. Hence it will not strip the wire.I cant be sure that all the job sites i go to will not have had  an idiot with a utility knife stripping electrical wire so i'm going to purchase the(Irwin Industrial Tools 2078309 Stripperas a backup for those instances.,Y,N,,,
B000OQ21CA,Will this work for speaker wire?,These are great but they will not take the place of a pair of normal wire strippers. They work great on 18 gauge wire up to 10 gauge Anything smaller or larger you will need something else. They are worth the cost. I would use them in semi-clean environments though for you contractors that do any outdoor wiring. Shipping was in two business days via amazon prime.,Y,N,,,
B000OQ21CA,Will this work for speaker wire?,When setting up my surround sound systems this tool was fantastic to have when needing to strip the ends of speaker cable. The automatic stripping functionality of this tool makes it so easy to strip the jacket-ends off of wire and strip them to an accurate length you desire. No complaints from my usage so far.,Y,Y,,,
B000OQ21CA,Will this work for speaker wire?,Only downside was that using these was not initially intuitive. But it is SUPER convenient! As of right now I have only used them to strip speaker wire (which it did flawlessly  and efficiently) RG6 coaxial wasnt as easy as the speaker wire was but was still easy enough. Just had to strip it in succession.,Y,Y,,,
B000OQ21CA,Will this work for speaker wire?,This wire stripper is very nice for low voltage projects. This product feels like it will last MANY years. it does a good job on speaker cables.

B000OQ21CA,Will this work for speaker wire?,I was looking forward to trying this thing out but it is completely useless for flat speaker wire.  It might work on heavy gauge speaker wire or on electric wire but it doesn't do a thing for thinner wire it just slides right through,Y,Y,,,

B005E48K6I,I ordered one just recently if this one has SOS and not just HILo &amp; strobe did I get the wrong model?,Great flashlight. Amazingly bright! Lights up the dark like nothing else I own! Only drawback is that I wish it took ordinary batteries.,Y,N,,,

B005E48K6I,I ordered one just recently if this one has SOS and not just HILo &amp; strobe did I get the wrong model?,light is not that bright and does not come with any batteries. The light is pretty cheap but with all the added accessories and shipping you can get allot better of a light. Cree has another light on amazon with a wider head and that thing is great and just a few more dollars. Nice product but not worth all the hassle to get it I mean I could of walked to the store and got one for the same price. Also watch who you buy it from!!!! I got the cheapest from somewhere in Asia. Those guys don't take pride in anything they make or send... first they sent me the wrong product and then replaced it with the right one and it looked like it had been dropped and dragged on gravel. They were friendly but had a very hard time speaking English and all in all it took me a month and a half to get one little flash light. I would send it back but I just dont want to deal with them anymore. PFFFFF.,Y,N,,,
B005E48K6I,I ordered one just recently if this one has SOS and not just HILo &amp; strobe did I get the wrong model?,I did not receive the 3 mode 900 lumen flashlight as described.  Mine was 5 mode and probably much closer to 250-300 lumens.  It also appeared to not be an authentic Ultrafire light based on the available products on their English website and lack of logo on led module.  It is still a very nice light well made and machined extremely well no grind at all in the threads.  On high the light lasts at least 1.5 hours.  It does get hot but not uncomfortably so.  However as this is not what I expected I did contact the seller in my case Coco Fed.  They responded within 12 hours and are currently working to correct the problem.  Very impressed.  To sum up; did not get exactly what I ordered but it is still a decent light and the seller is very responsive to my request to correct the problem.,Y,N,,,
B005E48K6I,I ordered one just recently if this one has SOS and not just HILo &amp; strobe did I get the wrong model?,This is my 2nd one of these. It is my spare living in my car. My other one I bought 1.5 years ago and it is amazing. I'd prefer a model that has just high/low beams as I've never used the flashing settings. My only complaint is that the Ultrafire batteries I bought are 50% unreliable.,Y,N,,,
B005E48K6I,I ordered one just recently if this one has SOS and not just HILo &amp; strobe did I get the wrong model?,I have 2 of the 5 mode version of this light. High medium (which isn't much dimmer than high) low strobe and SOS (which I think is of very limited usefulness). A friend of mine bought the 3 mode light(which is the topic of this review) and when he saw mine he wished he got mine because of the strobe. Both lights are top notch in quality beautifully finished switch is smooth and in my opinion rivals the quality of lights costing much more. In fact I was in my local gun shop recently and showed the counter guy my light. He was impressed  and when I told him what i paid for it he called the over the owner to see it. He commented that it was as good the best ones they sold (highest being $120.00).Both the 3 & 5 mode are great lights & great values. Just wanted to inform so you can select based on what features are important to you. I made my comments above based on experience from use. (Although I'm kind of partial to the 5 mode because of the strobe).Both are about the same price. They use a # 18650 Li-ion battery & charger; sold on amazon. Orlike me you can use the good cells from a defective laptop battery pack & buy a charger.To sum up I would like to comment on the most useful modes in my opinion. #1-the high is blazingly bright if it is shined in someone's eyes (not recommended if it's someone you like). They won't be seeing much for 5 min. or so. But the brightness is there to light up your yard from the house to find a small part lost on the floor etc. #2-on low it's about as bright as a 2 D-cell flashlight with new batteries. Good for walking your dog and other tasks. #3-the strobe; the example of walking at night.I attached a wrist lanyard to mine so there's no chance of dropping it. Set it on low for normal and if someone is near you that you feel may intend to do you harm click it on strobe & aim right in the eyes. They will be totally blinded (temporarily) & disoriented giving you time to get to safety.(Which is the main purpose of strobe mode and it can also be used as an emergency beacon). Sorry this ran so long but I hope someone finds it helpful.,Y,Y,,,
B005E48K6I,I ordered one just recently if this one has SOS and not just HILo &amp; strobe did I get the wrong model?,This light works great. I just wish I would have read. I don't care for the strobe feature wish it had just the High and Low option. Will be looking for one that has just those 2 outputs....Also order the batteries you need for this light. They are next to impossible to find and any common stores. The batteries are 18650,Y,Y,,,
B005E48K6I,I ordered one just recently if this one has SOS and not just HILo &amp; strobe did I get the wrong model?,"This light is good but not THAT good. The 501B model also says 900 lumens and it is noticeably brighter than this light. The 502B has a super white light but it's very narrow (see my pics). The 501B model is warmer but still by far the best LED light I've ever used in fact. SMOKES most every $100-$200 ""pro"" light on the market it really is that good. My guess is that that engine was mistakenly sold and installed in that light for the price? Skip this one (502B) unless you absolutely must have the belt clip. Still a great light for the money don't get me wrong. 4 stars.",Y,N,,,
B005E48K6I,I ordered one just recently if this one has SOS and not just HILo &amp; strobe did I get the wrong model?,I purchased this light only because I wanted a strong and bright light and I did get that it was the model no. described but did not do any functions other than on-off. Light is very powerful and construction is rugged. I purchased an additional 4 units with battery chargers for gifts but they are different from the first model even though they have the same model no. the internal construction is different. They also do the multiple functions as described and are also constructed very well and do look the same. I don't believe you could get a stronger or better constructed light for the same money. Use caution when ordering specific model Hopefully everyone will be pleased with their gifts.,Y,N,,,

The wheels are smaller than the poly wheels I've been buying to support my home made tool carts but they run a lot smoother.  The front wheels swivel smoothly.

B00002262M,Would this work for a stacked washer/dryer? It is in front of the hot water heater in a small narrow closet.,"My shop rolls on HTC products and I've always been happy with them.I restored an old Parks planer and the footprint fit none of the dedicated basesso I opted to try one of the universal bases.  Big mistake.Unlike the dedicated bases the fixed wheels have no brake on them.  THe machine rests on two small rubber pads and the wheels when ""stationary"" and that does not work out well.  The base is prone to movement as there is insufficient locking mechanisms- if this base had brakes it would be a nice option for odd pieces of machinery.",Y,N,,,

I was going to build my own but the cost of angle iron and locking heavy duty casters was the same as the HTC2000.

B00002262M,Would this work for a stacked washer/dryer? It is in front of the hot water heater in a small narrow closet.,If a tool is to be judged on it's utility then this is a winner. What makes this base so great is that it does what it's supposed to do does it well and sells for around fifty bucks.My shop is so small Hennie Youngman could do a whole routine around it. I don't have the luxury of thousands of square feet of space to plant work stations and production tools.  So I rely on putting everything on wheels to keep it out of the way untill I need it.  I made my own untill I discovered the HTC2000 mobile base.I ordered one for my jointer and another for my table saw.  My jointer is now a dream come true!  The large wheels track easily and smoothly and it sets down firmly.  The only drawback was that the front was higher than the back but that is an easy fix with a spacer or adjusting up your machines leveling feet.Oddly enough I did not have this problem on the second one I ordered for the table saw. That on is so level you could set grade with it. For the life of me I can't figure the difference but who cares?  The only downside I noticed on the one for the table saw was that my saw may be a little heavy for it.  I have an old big Craftsman with a custom made T-Square fence.  It rolls very nicely but the cam levers for raising and lowering seem to strain a little in the lift mode.  If you are going to move larger machinery I would suggest contacting the company regarding their custom made program.Overall if you ever want a stationary machine to have any portability you can't go wrong with this product.  And at this price you can afford a little custom tuning to get exactly what you want.,Y,N,,,

A small time saving note-My band saw has a small access/storage compartment on the base.  After I put it into the onto the mobile base I realized I couldn't open the door.  I had to move my 300lb Bandsaw (ouch) off the mobile base insert a peice of 3/4 plywood to elevate it enough for the door to open and it works great...my back is another story thanks to my poor planning.

B00002262M,Would this work for a stacked washer/dryer? It is in front of the hot water heater in a small narrow closet.,"I have two of these.  One is under my Delta Bandsaw the other under my Ridgid 6"" Jointer.  Both are well suited for the task.  You have to be careful with the jointer as it has a narrow base though.",Y,N,,,
B004GIO0F8,are these hex shank bits,Came in as expected was the exact same product lowes sells and was equal in quality.  The prices was less here then at lowes here in California.,N,N,,,
B004GIO0F8,are these hex shank bits,Each bit is nice and sharp and seems like they will last a long time. Cuts through everything I have used them for like a hot knife through butter!,N,N,,,
B004GIO0F8,are these hex shank bits,as a handy man I run into jobs that require a good drill bit and its nice to have this kit,N,N,,,
B004GIO0F8,are these hex shank bits,These are sharp and the range of sizes are great too. Have used them on wood and metal in these first few weeks of owning them. Neighbor asked if I had HSS bits to drill holes into 1/4 inch metal plates. So I went to his home with these to try them out. And they cut into the metal fast and easy. In no time the project was done. None have broke as of yet and even after drilling into the 1/4 metal they are still sharp. The anti slip triangle shape is a time saver also. Once you have it correctly in your key-less chuck you can start drilling without the hassle of having it spin around wildly as you drill into the project. These are easy to use easy to get the size your looking for have a tough case included and with proper use will last a long time. YES I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE DRILL BITS.,N,N,,,
B004GIO0F8,are these hex shank bits,These are my favorite drill bits!!! The pilot works great makes drilling fast and accurate. I would recommend these for the shop or home.,N,N,,,
B004GIO0F8,are these hex shank bits,These seem to be the same design as the old Black and Decker Bullet-Point bits.  I find pilot-point bits extremely helpful with metals and hardwoods.  These are generally very good at self-clearing except in the case of uncured woods.  These are great bits and will last a long time if cared for properly.,N,N,,,
B004GIO0F8,are these hex shank bits,Using these drill bits are like cutting through butter.  I went through wood very quickly and cleanly.  The set is high quality and the Pilot Point makes it easier.  Milwaukee drill bits are good too but they do not have the Pilot Points.  I would recommend these DeWalt drill bits.,N,N,,,
B004GIO0F8,are these hex shank bits,I had a trusty set of Black & Decker bits that I used for years and probably for a few years longer than I should have.  They weren't nearly as high quality as these either.  The tips are very sharp the whole bits are solid and the case is sturdy and convenient.  The no-spin shank is nice also in harder materials.These seem to be very high quality and I expect to get years of use out of them.,N,N,,,
B004GIO0F8,are these hex shank bits,I can't think of a better bit set for a drill I just wish they made it with the 1/4&#34; hex so it can be used on my impact as well but it works great in everything from woods and plastics all the way to steel I-beams I trust it will get any job but masonary done quick hands down one of the best sets there are,N,N,,,
B004GIO0F8,are these hex shank bits,I ordered this set mainly because of the Hex shaft feature.  However hex shafts are only found on 3/16&#34; bits and larger.There are other extra nice features however:1. Each bit is mounted in the case by tilting and inserting the shaft into a hole then clicking it down into place very secure fixation.2. There are two each of the more easily damaged bits: 1/16&#34; 1/8&#34; 5/64&#34; and 3/32&#34;.Overall a very nice high quality set but I wish even the smaller bits had hex heads as the one I seem to have the most trouble with in the past is the 1/8&#34;.,N,Y,,,
B0002TW1D8,"Will I be able to use these as a replacement to my 5/16"" allen wrench for my 3/8"" socket head bolts?",This is a quality set at a quality price.  They work great no issues at all.  Worth the money all the way.,Y,N,,,
B0002TW1D8,"Will I be able to use these as a replacement to my 5/16"" allen wrench for my 3/8"" socket head bolts?",light weight sturdy easy to load perfect fit......the length could of been a bit longer maybe 2 inches more other than that its perfectly good....,Y,N,,,
B0002TW1D8,"Will I be able to use these as a replacement to my 5/16"" allen wrench for my 3/8"" socket head bolts?",They serve a purpose and they were inexpensive. I bought them just to have in the bag if I needed them. I light spray of oil would probably keep them in better condition.,Y,N,,,
B0002TW1D8,"Will I be able to use these as a replacement to my 5/16"" allen wrench for my 3/8"" socket head bolts?",I don't have an impact wrench so I can use these with my cordless drill and once I loosen bolts by hand these will make it so much quicker to take off or put on.,Y,N,,,
B0002TW1D8,"Will I be able to use these as a replacement to my 5/16"" allen wrench for my 3/8"" socket head bolts?","Purchased this as an ""add on item"" with a cordless drill. Inexpensive and cheaply made drill bit adapters. Wobly when fit into socket especially the 3/8"" but did noy break or bend when used with an 18 volt cordless drill. For limited use only but are cheap enough to replace.",Y,Y,,,
B0002TW1D8,"Will I be able to use these as a replacement to my 5/16"" allen wrench for my 3/8"" socket head bolts?",If you have one of those new impact drills which is something everyman needs in his tool box you will need something similar to these drive/adaptors. All impact drills have a mechanical head that fits these extensions. These extensions allow you to use your 1/4 3/8 and 1/2&#34; sockets on your impact drill. If you want to use your impact drill as a drill you will also need a drill adapter which is made by DeWalt. I find that using an impact drill to drill long screws into exterior wood to be far superior to a 3/8&#34; regular variable speed drill due to the impact drills size and weight.,Y,Y,,,
B0002TW1D8,"Will I be able to use these as a replacement to my 5/16"" allen wrench for my 3/8"" socket head bolts?",I bought these to go with my new dewalt 20v/Max kit so i could use all sorts of different sockets.  These are well made and hold up to tough use.  the 3 bits are as follows 1/4hex to 1/4 3/8 and 1/2&#34;  Can't beat it for the price.,Y,Y,,,
B0002TW1D8,"Will I be able to use these as a replacement to my 5/16"" allen wrench for my 3/8"" socket head bolts?","I used the largest adapter with a 5/8"" socket running 6"" lag bolts into sill board. The drill complained but the adapter did not. If I have any problems with any out of this set I'll edit my review.August 22 2011 edit:I just bought a second set to keep with my Bosch cordless drill/impactor setup. Chucked it in my 18V Bosch impactor to remove 2"" long 5/16"" socket head seized up bolts (were holding metal track into concrete). Worked nicely. What bolts didnt come out simply had their heads broken off. Havent yet had need to use impactor with any of the lager size adapters yet. If I have issues with them I'll update my post to reflect.September 2011 edit:Used the 3/8 chuck adapter with a 3/4"" socket to run 6"" lag bolts into predrilled holes. worked ok but the torque deformed the body of the adapter slightly and the quick release chuck on the 18V impactor didnt want to release it. A few taps with a hammer on the side of the adapter and it got unstuck. Looks like it's time to get a better adapter set for the impact driver!",Y,Y,,,
B0002TW1D8,"Will I be able to use these as a replacement to my 5/16"" allen wrench for my 3/8"" socket head bolts?",Pros:Does the job. fits perfectly to the impact driver and to the 1/4 3/8 and 1/2 inch sockets.Cons:Did not really find any.,Y,Y,,,

B0015UC17E,can i change the lense color,Its a concentrated light more than sufficient for electrical repairs and easy to store almost anywhere so you actually have it when you need it.,N,N,,,
B0015UC17E,can i change the lense color,This is a nice bright light that comes with a case to allow easy carrying.  This light would easily fit in a pants pocket or purse for quick access.,N,N,,,
B0015UC17E,can i change the lense color,Works like it's suppose to with a long battery life to boot...haven't tried hitting anything with it so i'm not sure how tough it is.,N,N,,,
B0015UC17E,can i change the lense color,This flashlight is quite compact. The build quality is great. Though the intensity is only 24 lumen it is enough for daily use. Do not expect it to be super bright. If the brightness is important to you you may want to consider Fenix LD20. It is two and half times the money (Amazon won't let me put down the amount). But you get 180 lumen. I would think these two flashlights serve different purposes.The only complaint I can think of is the possible scratch when you change the battery. The clip will slightly scratch the body. You can put a piece of paper between them to prevent that. Other than that this is a great flashlight. Do not get those cheap less than 10 dollars LED flashlights. It is not worth the hassles and agonies to put up with those cheap stuff.,N,N,,,
B0015UC17E,can i change the lense color,Got this for my work. Really happy with it. Keep it in my right shirt pocket. Very handy. Saw some other reviews with battery acid issues. Maybe change them more often?Hope I don't have that problem. Will NOT be happy and it WILL get sent in for warranty replacement.,N,N,,,
B0015UC17E,can i change the lense color,I really like this light. It is solid and feels good in the hand. When its clipped in your pocket you won't notice it.  The light is a nice bright white. I really like the color. Another nice thing is the momentary on feature on the clicky switch. Awesome light all around. If you want a 2xaaa light this is the one to get.,N,N,,,
B0015UC17E,can i change the lense color,I am a flashlight-o-holic. I pay attention to lumen rating throw type (wide or narrow) color of the light and the shape of the torch. This is my favorite flashlight because it uses two AA batteries and provides a long runtime. The shape is narrow enough that I can clip it to the inside pocket of my jacket and have it with me at any time. This is a great every day carry (EDC) that you can use in pinch because it is always with you. I dropped one into my wife's purse so she has a light if she needs it. This is a quality light and does cost a bit but it is worth it.,N,N,,,
B0015UC17E,can i change the lense color,I'm very happy with this light use it every day. battery seemed to last  pretty good. I think I could've got it cheaper locally but I wanted the silver color not black..,N,N,,,
B0015UC17E,can i change the lense color,Seriously good flashlight. Is very bright easy to use convenient and lasts for a long time. I've had mine for over a year I think and never had to change the battery with mild usage.,N,N,,,
B0015UC17E,can i change the lense color,Super bright I love that it runs on AAA batteries. I've had it for about a year now and only just this month had to change them. It's even slim enough for an every day carry EDC flashlight.,N,N,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it run off 18650 3.7V Li-ion 5300mAh,Blindingly bright... this thing makes a shadow inside on a sunny day & throws an almost lazer like beam at night - incredible for one LED!,Y,N,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it run off 18650 3.7V Li-ion 5300mAh,And low priced. Battery life typical of this type which is probably more like 250- 300 lumen than 1000. Has a 3 position switch not 5. It's a good deal at the price but delivery is very slow but what can you expect for $12?,Y,N,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it run off 18650 3.7V Li-ion 5300mAh,Hand held not to large and has a very bright light. This flash light only uses one battery and lights up the night or the house. For the price you simply can not beat this deal.,Y,N,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it run off 18650 3.7V Li-ion 5300mAh,I love this light I bought!! It's incredibly bright and with an 18650 battery and charger you won't have to be spending a fortune on batteries all the time!! I highly recommend it!!,Y,Y,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it run off 18650 3.7V Li-ion 5300mAh,The description says Trustfire The photo shows a Kinfire. The light I received is an Ultrafire. So you'll have to guess which one you'll receive. My light has &#34;next mode&#34; memory. Every time you switch it off it will start in the next mode when switched back on. IE: Shut it off in low mode and it will start in strobe mode when you switch it back on. ETC.Unless you have a great memory you'll have to guess which mode it will start in. A very stupid mode system IMO.The quality seems to be fair like other Ultrafire lights. It's not 1000 lm. though and not as bright as most of my other XM-L T6 lights. Maybe 500 lm. 350 or so OTFThe only reason I don't return it is because I paid for it with a $10.00 amazon gift card that I wonso it cost me nothing. NOT recommended unless you like guessing games.,Y,N,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it run off 18650 3.7V Li-ion 5300mAh,I have a lot of flashlights  with kids in scouts  leaving in the country on acreage these lights are the best combination of LED/Battery and durability.  they are so bright I can spot a deer at about 900 feet down my fence line.  Please note they get hot!  like any high output CREE T6 LED light they will get hot!  Please make sure you use good batteries with safety circuits like the Tenergy 18650 brand make sure you see PCB circuit!  also get a few extra.  I have a charge that has 4 charging and I purchase 8 Tenergy 18650 batteries to supply my 3 flashlights.,Y,Y,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it run off 18650 3.7V Li-ion 5300mAh,Bought this light to replace my Rigid industries Halo light that walked away from me at work. Not nearly as bright as my old RI torch not even close. looks to be more closer to 400 lumens then the clamed 1000L. im runing the light off of my old RI 18650 2400mah batteries . Will buy more lights because they are cost effective and i do have some soldering know how to fix it if something does break. Good bang for buck buy since my old RI Halo was 100$,Y,Y,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it run off 18650 3.7V Li-ion 5300mAh,This is the only light I need it is small and compact with a very bright lite if you face it up it will light the whole room go for one you will be amazed how bright they are,Y,N,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it run off 18650 3.7V Li-ion 5300mAh,I was a little skeptical given the price but being that I'm looking for a super bright LED to keep in my emergency supplies.....power outages storms etc.....I figured I'd give it a try. Along with the light I had also ordered a spare set of batteries and charger. I set the batteries to charge over night and by the following night took it out for a test run. Super bright!!!! The bright mode throws a concentrated beam across the yard and when tested across a pasture it was plenty bright enough to light up several hundred feet to the woodline. I'm pleased with this light and will purchase extras to keep in the truck and atv's.,Y,N,,,
B005VCJNYG,will it run off 18650 3.7V Li-ion 5300mAh,I have bought this same light from three different suppliers and the quality and performance are always top notch. Very well made and bright. Has settings of high med low strobe and SOS. Great deal for the price. Takes the 18650 Li-Ion rechargeable battery.,Y,Y,,,
B004Y6V5CI,is it a plug in,Needed this for my camping travel trailer ... seems to work and shows the current levels at all times. Exactly what I needed and fit the bill perfectly.,N,N,,,
B004Y6V5CI,is it a plug in,Working very well so far.  Just have children and it'll get tested plenty frequently.  The peak level thing works pretty well.,N,N,,,
B004Y6V5CI,is it a plug in,So far so good,N,N,,,
B004Y6V5CI,is it a plug in,This carbon monoxide detector is the best there is. I had this in my hallway for several weeks now and it has not let me down once. I run a generator sometimes on are screened in porch in this thing will alert me if any fumes are getting into the house.,N,N,,,
B004Y6V5CI,is it a plug in,Kidde is a well-known name is fire extinguishing and fire-alarm equipment. This alarm is very well crafted and easy to install.  Because the display is not lighted it should be mounted at eye-level or slightly higher  That works out very nicely because CO is slightly lighter than air particularly if it is caused by some kind of combustion.  The sound of the alarm is loud enough so that it can be heard throughout the house.,N,N,,,
B004Y6V5CI,is it a plug in,The best things about this alarm are its portability--you can carry it from room to room; its battery operation so you don't have to plug it in and use up yet another outlet; and best of all the peace of mind it gives you so you know there is no carbon monoxide fumes sneaking around trying to kill you.  OK so I'm paranoid about silent killers but you never know.  And this will let you sleep at night without worrying whether or not your clothes dryer (or whatever) is spewing silent undetectable fumes.  Don't you hate that when it happens?,N,N,,,
B004Y6V5CI,is it a plug in,Very small and easy to use. I like this one over the other brand because it holds the peak reading until you reset it. The other brand clears the memory every 24 hours. The other brand is also much bigger and takes up more space. The other brand is also more expensive.... so this is easy. Great product. Both seem to work the same. Note: This one does not have 110AC plug you must use batteries the other brand is 110V AC and/or batteries.,N,N,,,
B004Y6V5CI,is it a plug in,This is a well thought out CO detector. It has a digital display. It will warn of end of life in addition to all the usual safety warnings. I originally used only 110v plug in models and preferred not to make holes in the wall. I have since decided in favor of the better placement options of battery powered models. I will change the batteries annually and not wait for the low battery chirp. I recommend that everyone set a calendar appointment on their phones. No need to remember and no excuse to forget to ever put in fresh batteries.,N,N,,,
B004Y6V5CI,is it a plug in,I only use the display based CO monitors as one is used in a aircraft hanger where a low level of fumes can happen. The display gives one confidence that a false alarm really is just that. Having been spoiled with the display I also use the same type at home.Both of the displays are used where a plug in unit would not be practical so this unit was ideal.As far as I can tell both units purchased worked perfectly and the small size made them easier to place than some of the large round units.,N,Y,,,
B004Y6V5CI,is it a plug in,It comes with batteries easy to install and waa laa....... Great deal to be safe and sound. I like that I can set it anywhere I wish or hang it up. I don't want a plug in. No problems at all. I will say the instructions are a bit tricky lol......but a normal IQ will have no problem using this monitor. A person never knows when or if there may be a leak inside. Easy to read too. Arrived on time of course and packed well. Nice product and I would buy again if I needed another one.,N,Y,,,

B00396S1Q2,Does the 88031 have the problem where it is too hot to touch after 10 - 15 minutes of use? Thank you.,My daily carry light shows some wear from constantly being in my pocket but it takes all that abuse in stride.,Y,N,,,
B00396S1Q2,Does the 88031 have the problem where it is too hot to touch after 10 - 15 minutes of use? Thank you.,After using and owning many tactical lights (cheap and expensive) I have been very impressed with the value of all the streamlights I have purchased.  The 88031 Protac is no exception.  I have several lights that are programmable (allow varying changes in intensity and/or strobe features) but it got to the point where I was forgetting how to program the different lights.  This light on the other hand allows me to toggle through three modes (High intensity strobe and low intensity) quickly by repeatedly pressing the tail switch.  This feature has made this light my favorite EDC especially when traveling because it is quickly versatile and I don't have to remember how to program it.  This is the same reason why I really like the 1AA protac that I use around the house (cheaper to feed it batteries).  It is not however my night stand light.  I still use a 4sevens Quark123(2) that is programmable (I leave the settings on high output and with a quick twist of the head of the light it goes into strobe mode).  The Quark would be better in an emergency home defense situation because of that feature.  The Quark was also almost twice the cost when I bought it though.  Bringing me back to this light I am extremely pleased with how good/bright the beam is.  It is not quite as bright as a Surefire E2D but it costs about a third as much and has a strobe function.  Also this light is incredibly lightweight with a smaller head than most lights that have less features.  For the money I couldn't be happier.  Not to mention I won't cry as much if I lose/break it compared to a $100 plus tactical light.,Y,N,,,
B00396S1Q2,Does the 88031 have the problem where it is too hot to touch after 10 - 15 minutes of use? Thank you.,I purchased this for the strobe feature.  It takes some practice to push the end cap button in just the correct pattern to get the strobe one quick touch then a push to lock it on.  Trying to get it to the low setting has been a bit of a pain.  It takes two quick touches and a locking press.  Specifically the instructions say those touches need to take place within .8 seconds.,Y,N,,,
B00396S1Q2,Does the 88031 have the problem where it is too hot to touch after 10 - 15 minutes of use? Thank you.,I have it on me 24/7 and use it a lot. The only problem I have had with it is when its used on HI for more then 5 min it gets very hot. So hot its almost impossible to hang onto. On HI it will light up any room and can light up anything 75 yards away and the strobe is better then any other flashlight I own. It is a very well made product I would buy another one if this one grew legs.Update: The battery's don't last long when used daily. To save money on battery's I replaced it with the Protac 1AA. That light uses 1 AA battery. Its less then half as many Lumen but is better then most multi-cells ive used. I have been using it for over a month on the same AA battery. The Protac 2L is a great light but is only now used for emergency's or when something goes bump in the night.,Y,Y,,,

Thank you.,-1/3 star for significant heat production-1/3 star for questionable LED protector (front)-1/3 star for strobe being second click instead of thirdOne thing that surprised me was how small this light is.

B00396S1Q2,Does the 88031 have the problem where it is too hot to touch after 10 - 15 minutes of use? Thank you.,&#34;Apples to Apples&#34;I figured many people looking at this product have or are also considering the very inexpensive Cree 7W 300LM Mini LED Flashlight (which I've also purchased and reviewed) so here's my comparison of both and also why I chose the 88031 model with 2 CR123A's over the models that use a single CR123A AA or AAA batteries...Cree 7W 300LM Mini LED Flashlight:---First glance...You notice the low price (I'll get to in a minute) and secondly you see around 1000 reviews with 90% of people giving either 5 stars or 1 star with very few in the middle.---Reviews -whether good or bad are all seemingly based on 2 things. 5 stars= they received an ACTUAL Cree not a knock-off and came from a distributor in the USA. I ordered 2 which I manually selected (for an extra .40 cents) to come from a US distributor called &#34;Welltop&#34;. So they arrived in 3 days and were marked with the legit &#34;Cree&#34; as it should be on the side. 1 star= either received knock-off P.O.S's or ordered from a Hong Kong distributor taking 3-4 weeks either way a hassle and waste of money.---Quality (if made by Cree) well... the price should say a lot. Provided you dish out the extra $ for the UltraFire 14500 1200mah 3.6V Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery (Pair) + Charger Combo -also from Welltop- then they work well and are insanely bright. That's about where it ends... They are not shock or water resistant so don't mount one on a firearm and will tend to get very hot as you drain the battery which lasts about 90 minutes on &#34;high&#34;. This like the Streamlight also has High Low and Strobe -a very slow strobe so carry the back up battery or after that initial power burst it settles at the same brightness a cheap incondescent bulb has.---Overall: A good price and purchase idea using them for similar things as I now do (i.e. letting the dog out one by the night stand if the kids need one to play with etc...). Simply put NOT a reliable emergency hard worker's LEO or tactical flashlight.*************************Streamlight 88031 Protac Tactical Flashlight 2L with White LED Includes 2 CR123A Lithium Batteries:---First glance  ...Okay a bit pricey but over 1000 reviews with 95% being 5 stars. Which do I choose and what's the catch?---Reviews  Just like Streamlight's reputation and other products consistantly excellent and very accurate. There are bound to be some shipping mistakes or minor defects when tens of thousands are sold but there's a reason people choose to &#34;exchange&#34; for anothr and not &#34;return&#34; for a refund. Read other reviews just as they say -if I could give more than 5 stars I would. Some have a problem with the &#34;High Strobe Low&#34; order but it's logical with you want the strobe to use the brightest light setting which precedes it. And this is a REAL strobe... as in give the bad guy a seizure strobe.---Quality -where your price difference is. Streamlight (unlike some other makers &#34;cough...Surefire...cough&#34;) does not tack on any extra zeroes for a brand name. This price is all product and coming from a guy who first bought the Cree can honestly say this flashlight is worth double what Streamlight is charging. Here's why I bought 2 more after my first. This has been submeged in mud puddles mounted and fired on both my 12ga shotgun & AR15 (5.56 NATO) chewed on by my dog left in freezing cars and on burning hot barrels dropped about 389 ti... 390 times and right now is in my pocket working perfectly -aside from some cosmetic damage but this ain't a beauty contest (though new out of the box would win). The other 2 I bought are mounted on those firearms which being so nice and slim only required wrapping electrical tape around it to the point of needed thickness (also needed with the Cree if you put it on ummm an airsoft gun).---Overall this little guy is a beast worth more than,Y,N,,,
B00396S1Q2,Does the 88031 have the problem where it is too hot to touch after 10 - 15 minutes of use? Thank you.,The 88031 is a nice little flashlight with good light and the only thing that is a bit annoying is the switch.  It is not easy to go from High to Strobe. Even going from High to Low is a hit of miss deal.  Still it is cheaper than a Surefire.,Y,N,,,
B00396S1Q2,Does the 88031 have the problem where it is too hot to touch after 10 - 15 minutes of use? Thank you.,I purchased the Streamlight 88040 ProTAC HL High Lumen Professional Tactical Light and found it to be extremely bright. It is well constructed and seems as if it will hold up well time will tell. One concern is that after a few minutes the front end does get very warm / hot to the touch at this point that has not created any problems but I would be reluctant to leave the light on for extended periods of time. So if you're looking for a high-powered tactical light for short duration use such as disorienting and intruder this product fits the requirements.Pros:- solid construction- relatively small lightweight- extremely bright for its sizeCons:- the head gets very warm after only a minute or two of use this is only a concern at this point.I would recommend this flashlight for the specific tactical use which it is designed for. After using the product for about a week I went ahead and purchased a second one.,Y,Y,,,

B000IKK0OI,Will it find dry wall screws in a ceiling (i.e. stick to the ceiling without falling)?,I've used other fancy finders before. There is no doubt with this one. I was skeptical but now I'm a believer. This was a nice cheap investment that works great.,Y,N,,,
B000IKK0OI,Will it find dry wall screws in a ceiling (i.e. stick to the ceiling without falling)?,works with strong magnets and hang on when nail is located. No batteries or lightsjust plane old magnetic force. simply beautiful.,Y,N,,,
B000IKK0OI,Will it find dry wall screws in a ceiling (i.e. stick to the ceiling without falling)?,This compliments my expensive electronic studfinder. I use both religiously. Because I am installing dental X-ray equipment on walls that are 1 to 100+ years old I never know what I'm up against. Walls can be 2-4 layers thick of drywall and I've even had 5&#34; of pure old time plaster....not to mention random wood studs that may or may not go floor to ceiling. This finds the drywall screw/nail heads while the electronic finds the stud. Neither always work but 95% of the time one does saving my posterior.I always leave the Hanson hang on the screw head as a reference point (almost forgetting to bring it with me later).The drawback other than the obvious missing screw heads is that the back can get dirty so when searching for screws on a low quality paint wall it can leave smudges. I've cleaned the back with alcohol but I still must be very careful on some white walls.,Y,N,,,
B000IKK0OI,Will it find dry wall screws in a ceiling (i.e. stick to the ceiling without falling)?,Haven't had a chance to really put it to use yet but the magnets are powerful and the design seems nice and convenient and compact.  Just keep in mind that this has limitations compared with other designs - since you're only able to identify metal objects (for wood studs that means you're identifying the drywall screws) you can only identify studs of known location.  For example you won't really know where the ceiling joists are because they could be going north-south or east-west - there's no way to tell with this.  Also no way to identify fire rails.  But within its use seems like a great little tool!,Y,Y,,,
B000IKK0OI,Will it find dry wall screws in a ceiling (i.e. stick to the ceiling without falling)?,As others have mentioned this stud fighter merely sticks to nails in the studs.  The magnets on the product are very good and so I have not had any problems with it falling off the wall or it not being able to find nails if you move it around in large areas.  So for what it is meant to do it does as well as could be expected.  However if you need a stud finder that tells you where a stud begins and a stud ends then this would not be the product for you and you should get a digital stud finder.,Y,N,,,
B000IKK0OI,Will it find dry wall screws in a ceiling (i.e. stick to the ceiling without falling)?,I bought this little device after hearing how bad and overpriced some of the electronic stud finders truly are.  This thing essentially is two powerful magnets and a level with some straight line pointers.  This concept works great and I've used it to find studs all over the house for mounting TVs cabinets and heavy decorations.  Just have to use some basic exploration and math to tell where the studs are in the ceiling or walls since most studs are 16in apart.  Works great and I highly recommend buying one or two!,Y,Y,,,
B000IKK0OI,Will it find dry wall screws in a ceiling (i.e. stick to the ceiling without falling)?,I saw this on Amazon about 5 years back and was impressed by the reviews but for some reason did not purchase.Couple of years later saw it in Sears while wandering around - a few buck more but picked it up...this is the simplest and best stud finder right up until I misplaced it (I will find it at some point on a wall or somewhere &#34;I put it to keep it safe&#34; for the moment).Anyway I knew I was going to need it again and bought 3 thru Amazon.  I figure to give one to brother and even dad when the time arises.I have used this with so many projects where I needed to find the studs / joists behind the wall and ceiling (curtain rods storage racks bike hangers etc...).  I have also in the past used drywall anchors of different sorts and still do but try to limit their use as my kids seem to be able to reef on curtains and what not and the anchors sometimes come loose even fall out. Would much rather be on studs for even the lighter weight jobs.In the past I had purchased those ~$30 battery operated stud finders and I always seemed to get too many false readings that I would not trust the device in the end. But stupidly I would try another brand with the same results.With the magnetic stud finder I am able to find the drywall nails into the studs behind and easily find the studs and on my finished ceiling in the garage I was able to quickly find the joists and know the direction they were running.I seldom have that annoying feeling when drilling pilot holes you realize you missed the stud.This is a no brainer.  Buy one and keep it handy.  Or if you are like me you might want to get more than one.,Y,Y,,,
B000IKK0OI,Will it find dry wall screws in a ceiling (i.e. stick to the ceiling without falling)?,I received this a couple of days ago and was just playing around with it to see what I thought.  WOW!  No problem finding screw heads under the drywall.The only REAL con is if there's not a screw near where you want to put something you need to either use a laser level or draw a line.  This is an issue on a ceiling without a laser level.  Hence the four stars.,Y,Y,,,
B000IKK0OI,Will it find dry wall screws in a ceiling (i.e. stick to the ceiling without falling)?,When the Franklin Sensors ProSensor 710 can't locate a stud in a textured ceiling this one will with some patience. Excellent low-tech tool.,Y,Y,,,
